  \section{Quadratic Symbols}\label{append:Quadratic_Symbols}
    Let $p$ be an odd prime. We are often interested in when the equation $x^{2} = m \tmod{p}$ is solvable for some $m \in \Z$. The \textbf{Legendre symbol}\index{Legendre symbol} $\tlegendre{m}{p}$ keeps track of this:
    \[
      \legendre{m}{p} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $x^{2} \equiv m \tmod{p}$ is solvable}, \\ -1 & \text{if $x^{2} \equiv m \tmod{p}$ is not solvable}, \\ 0 & \text{if $m \equiv 0 \tmod{p}$}. \end{cases}
    \]
    \textbf{Euler's criterion}\index{Euler's criterion} gives an alternative expression for Legendre symbol when $m$ is coprime to $p$:
    \begin{proposition*}[Euler's criterion]
      Let $p$ be an odd prime and suppose $m \in \Z$ with $(m,p) = 1$. Then
      \[
        \legendre{m}{p} = m^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \tmod{p}.
      \]
    \end{proposition*}
    From the definition and Euler's criterion is it not difficult to show that the Legendre symbol satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:Legendre_symbol_properties}
      Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $a,b \in \Z$. Then the following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item If $a \equiv b \tmod{p}$ then $\tlegendre{a}{p} = \tlegendre{b}{p}$.
        \item $\tlegendre{ab}{p} = \tlegendre{a}{p}\tlegendre{b}{p}$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{proposition}
    From \cref{prop:Legendre_symbol_properties}, to compute the Legendre symbol in general it suffices to know how to compute $\tlegendre{-1}{p}$, $\tlegendre{2}{p}$, and $\tlegendre{q}{p}$ where $q$ is another odd prime. The \textbf{supplemental laws of quadratic reciprocity}\index{supplemental laws of quadratic reciprocity} are formulas for the first two symbols:
    \begin{proposition*}[Supplemental laws of quadratic reciprocity]
      Let $p$ be an odd prime. Then the following formulas hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item
        \[
          \legendre{-1}{p} = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $p \equiv 1 \tmod{4}$}, \\ -1 & \text{if $p \equiv 3 \tmod{4}$}. \end{cases}
        \]
        \item
        \[
          \legendre{2}{p} = (-1)^{\frac{p^{2}-1}{8}} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $p \equiv 1,7 \tmod{8}$}, \\ -1 & \text{if $p \equiv 3,5 \tmod{8}$}. \end{cases}
        \]
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{proposition*}
    The \textbf{law of quadratic reciprocity}\index{law of quadratic reciprocity} handles the last symbol by relating $\tlegendre{q}{p}$ to $\tlegendre{p}{q}$:
    \begin{theorem*}[Law of quadratic reciprocity]
      Let $p$ and $q$ be odd primes. Then
      \[
        \legendre{p}{q} = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}\legendre{q}{p}.
      \]
    \end{theorem*}
    We can generalize the Jacobi symbol further by making it multiplicative in the denominator. Let $n$ be a positive odd integer with prime factorization $n = p_{1}^{r_{1}} \cdots p_{k}^{r_{k}}$ and let $m \in \Z$. The \textbf{Jacobi symbol}\index{Jacobi symbol} $\tlegendre{m}{n}$ is defined by
    \[
      \legendre{m}{n} = \prod_{1 \le i \le k}\legendre{m}{p_{i}}^{r_{i}}.
    \]
    When $n = p$ is prime, the Jacobi symbol reduces to the Legendre symbol and the Jacobi symbol is precisely the unique multiplicative extension of the Legendre symbol to all positive odd integers. Accordingly, the Jacobi symbol has the following properties:
    \begin{proposition}
      Let $m$ and $n$ be positive odd integers and let $a,b \in \Z$. Then the following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item If $a \equiv b \tmod{p}$ then $\tlegendre{a}{n} = \tlegendre{b}{n}$.
        \item $\tlegendre{a}{mn} = \tlegendre{a}{m}\tlegendre{a}{n}$.
        \item $\tlegendre{ab}{n} = \tlegendre{a}{n}\tlegendre{b}{n}$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{proposition}
    There is also an associated reciprocity law:
    \begin{proposition}
      Let $m$ and $n$ be positive odd integers. Then
      \[
        \legendre{m}{n} = (-1)^{\frac{m-1}{2}\frac{n-1}{2}}\legendre{n}{m}.
      \]
    \end{proposition}
    We can further generalize the Jacobi symbol so that it is valid for all integers. Let $m,n \in \Z$ where $n = up_{1}^{r_{1}} \cdots p_{k}^{r_{k}}$ is the prime factorization of $n$ with $u = \pm1$. The \textbf{Kronecker symbol}\index{Kronecker symbol} $\tlegendre{m}{n}$ is defined by
    \[
      \legendre{m}{n} = \legendre{m}{u}\prod_{1 \le i \le k}\legendre{m}{p_{i}}^{r_{i}},
    \]
    where we set
    \[
      \legendre{m}{1} = 1, \quad \legendre{m}{-1} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $m \ge 0$}, \\ -1 & \text{if $m < 0$}, \end{cases} \quad \legendre{m}{0} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $m = \pm 1$}, \\ 0 & \text{if $m \neq \pm 1$}, \end{cases}
    \]
    and
    \[
      \legendre{m}{2} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $m \equiv 1,7 \tmod{8}$}, \\ -1 & \text{if $m \equiv 3,5 \tmod{8}$}, \\ 0 & \text{if $m \equiv 0 \tmod{2}$}. \end{cases}
    \]
    When $n$ is a positive odd integer, the Kronecker symbol reduces to the Jacobi symbol. The Kronecker symbol also satisfies a reciprocity law:
    \begin{proposition}
      Let $m$ and $n$ be integers. Then
      \[
        \legendre{m}{n} = (-1)^{\frac{m^{(2)}-1}{2}\frac{n^{(2)}-1}{2}}\legendre{n}{|m|},
      \]
      where $m^{(2)}$ and $n^{(2)}$ are the parts of $m$ and $n$ relatively prime to $2$ respectively.
    \end{proposition}
\chapter{Analysis}
  \section{Local Absolute Uniform Convergence}
    Throughout, all functions are understood to complex-valued and regions are understood to be those of $\R^{n}$ or $\C^{n}$. Often, we are interested in some series
    \[
      \sum_{n \ge 1}f_{n}(\mathbf{x}),
    \]
    where of analytic functions $f_{n}(\mathbf{x})$ on some region $D$. We say that the series above is \textbf{locally absolutely uniformly convergent}\index{locally absolutely uniformly convergent} if
    \[
      \sum_{n \ge 1}|f_{n}(\mathbf{x})|,
    \]
    converges uniformly on compact subsets of $D$. A common method to determine if series is absolutely uniformly convergent is to use the Weierstrass $M$-test:

    \begin{theorem*}[Weierstrass $M$-test]
      Suppose $(f_{n}(\mathbf{x}))_{n \ge 1}$ is a sequence of functions on a region $D$ and there is a nonnegative sequence $(M_{n})_{n \ge 1}$ such that $|f_{n}(\mathbf{x})| \le M_{n}$ for all $n \ge 1$ and
      \[
        \sum_{n \ge 1}M_{n},
      \]
      converges. Then
      \[
        \sum_{n \ge 1}f_{n}(\mathbf{x}),
      \]
      is absolutely uniformly convergent on $D$.
    \end{theorem*}

    Applying the Weierstrass $M$-test to arbitrary compact subsets on a region shows that the resulting series is locally absolutely uniformly convergent. This mode of convergence is very useful because it is enough to guarantee the series is analytic on $D$:

    \begin{theorem}
      Suppose $(f_{n}(\mathbf{x}))_{n \ge 1}$ is a sequence of analytic functions on a region $D$. Then if
      \[
        \sum_{n \ge 1}f_{n}(\mathbf{x}),
      \]
      is locally absolutely uniformly convergent on $D$, it is analytic on $D$.
    \end{theorem}

    We can also apply this idea in the case of integrals. Suppose we have an integral
    \[
      \int_{D}f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,d\mathbf{y},
    \]
    where $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ is a complex-valued function on some region $D \x S$ and is analytic in $\mathbf{x}$ for every $\mathbf{y}$. The integral is a function of $\mathbf{x}$, and we say that the integral is \textbf{locally absolutely uniformly convergent}\index{locally absolutely uniformly convergent} if
    \[
      \int_{S}|f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})|\,d\mathbf{y},
    \]
    is uniformly bounded on compact subsets of $D$. Similar to the series case, this mode of convergence is very useful because it guarantees the integral is analytic on $D$:

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:analytic_integral}
      Suppose $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ is a complex-valued function on some region $D \x S$ and is analytic in $\mathbf{x}$ for every $\mathbf{y}$. Then if
      \[
        \int_{S}|f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})|\,d\mathbf{y},
      \]
      is locally absolutely uniformly convergent on $D$, it is analytic on $D$.
    \end{theorem}
  \section{Interchange of Integrals, Sums \& Derivatives}
    Often, we would like to interchange a limit and a sum or a limit and an integral. This process is not always allowed, but in many instances it is. For example, this is always possible for a monotonic sequence of functions:

    \begin{theorem*}[Monotone convergence theorem]
      The following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $(f_{n}(\mathbf{x}))_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of real-valued monotonic functions on some region $D$. Then for any $\mathbf{x}_{0} \in D$, we have
        \[
          \lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{x}_{0}}\sum_{n \ge 1}f_{n}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{x}_{0}}f_{n}(\mathbf{x}).
        \]
        \item Let $(f_{n}(\mathbf{x}))_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of real-valued monotonic integrable functions on some region $D$ with pointwise limit $f(\mathbf{x})$. Then $f(\mathbf{x})$ is integrable on $D$ and
        \[
          \lim_{n \to \infty}\int_{D}f_{n}(\mathbf{x})\,d\mathbf{x} = \int_{D}f(\mathbf{x})\,d\mathbf{x}.
        \]
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem*}

    In the instance where we do not necessarily have a monotonic sequence, the \textbf{dominated convergence theorem}\index{dominated convergence theorem} (DCT) covers the most well-known sufficient condition:

    \begin{theorem*}[Dominated convergence theorem]
      The following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $(f_{n}(\mathbf{x}))_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of functions on some region $D$ and such that
        \[
          \sum_{n \ge 1}f_{n}(\mathbf{x}),
        \]
        is absolutely convergent on $D$. Then for any $\mathbf{x}_{0} \in D$, we have
        \[
          \lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{x}_{0}}\sum_{n \ge 1}f_{n}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{x}_{0}}f_{n}(\mathbf{x}).
        \]
        \item Let $(f_{n}(\mathbf{x}))_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of continuous and integrable functions on some region $D$. Suppose that that the sequence converges pointwise to a function $f(\mathbf{x})$, and that there is some integrable function $g(\mathbf{x})$ on $D$ such that
        \[
          |f_{n}(\mathbf{x})| \le g(\mathbf{x}),
        \]
        for all $n \ge 1$ and all $\mathbf{x} \in D$. Then $f(\mathbf{x})$ is integrable on $D$ and
        \[
          \lim_{n \to \infty}\int_{D}f_{n}(\mathbf{x})\,d\mathbf{x} = \int_{D}f(\mathbf{x})\,d\mathbf{x}.
        \]
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem*}

    We would also like to interchange two sums, two integrals, or a sum and an integral assuming that one expression converges absolutely. This is sufficient as given by the \textbf{Fubini–Tonelli theorem}\index{Fubini–Tonelli theorem} (FTT):

    \begin{theorem*}[Fubini–Tonelli theorem]
      The following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item If $(f_{n,m}(\mathbf{x}))_{n,m \ge 1}$ is a sequence of continuous functions then
        \[
          \sum_{(n,m) \in \Z}f_{n,m}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\sum_{m \ge 1}f_{n,m}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{m \ge 1}\sum_{n \ge 1}f_{n,m}(\mathbf{x}),
        \]
        provided any of the expressions are absolutely convergent.
        \item If $(f_{n}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}))_{n}$ is a sequence of continuous and integrable functions on some region $D \x S$ then
        \[
          \int_{D \x S}f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,d(\mathbf{x} \x \mathbf{y}) = \int_{S}\int_{D}f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,d\mathbf{x}\,d\mathbf{y} = \int_{D}\int_{S}f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,d\mathbf{y}\,d\mathbf{x},
        \]
        provided any of the expressions are absolutely convergent.
        \item If $(f_{n}(\mathbf{x}))_{n \ge 1}$ is a sequence of continuous and integrable functions on some region $D$ then
        \[
         \sum_{n \ge 1}\int_{D}f_{n}(\mathbf{x})\,d\mathbf{x} = \int_{D}\sum_{n \ge 1}f_{n}(\mathbf{x})\,d\mathbf{x},
        \]
        provided either side is absolutely convergent.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem*}

    Other times we would also like to interchange a derivative and an integral. The \textbf{Leibniz integral rule}\index{Leibniz integral rule} tells us when this is allowed:

    \begin{theorem*}[Leibniz integral rule]
      Suppose $f(\mathbf{x},t)$ is a function on some region $D \x [a(\mathbf{x}),b(\mathbf{x})]$, for some real-valued functions $a(\mathbf{x})$ and $b(\mathbf{x})$, and such that both $f(\mathbf{x},t)$ and its partial derivative $\frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}f(\mathbf{x},t)$ are continuous in $\mathbf{x}$ and $t$. Also suppose that $a(\mathbf{x})$ and $b(\mathbf{x})$ are continuous with continuous partial derivatives $\frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}a(\mathbf{x})$ and $\frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}b(\mathbf{x})$ for $\mathbf{x} \in D$. Then
      \[
        \frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}\left(\int_{a(\mathbf{x})}^{b(\mathbf{x})}f(\mathbf{x},t)\,dt\right) = f(\mathbf{x},b(\mathbf{x}))\frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}b(\mathbf{x})-f(\mathbf{x},a(\mathbf{x}))\frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}a(\mathbf{x})+\int_{a(\mathbf{x})}^{b(\mathbf{x})}\frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}f(\mathbf{x},t)\,dt,
      \]
      on $D$.
    \end{theorem*}
    
    The Leibniz integral rule is sometimes applied in the case when $a(\mathbf{x}) = a$ and $b(\mathbf{x}) = b$ are constant. In this case, we get the following corollary:

    \begin{corollary}
      Suppose $f(\mathbf{x},t)$ is a function on some region $D \x [a,b]$, for some $a < b$, and such that both $f(\mathbf{x},t)$ and its partial derivative $\frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}f(\mathbf{x},t)$ are continuous in $\mathbf{x}$ and $t$. Then
      \[
        \frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}\left(\int_{a}^{b}f(\mathbf{x},t)\,dt\right) = \int_{a}^{b}\frac{\del}{\del x_{i}}f(\mathbf{x},t)\,dt,
      \]
      on $D$.
    \end{corollary}
  \section{Factorizations, Order \& Rank}\label{append:Factorizations_and_Finite_Order}
    The \textbf{elementary factors}\index{elementary factors}, also referred to as \textbf{primary factors}\index{primary factors}, are the entire functions $E_{n}(z)$ defined by
    \[
      E_{n}(z) = \begin{cases} 1-z & \text{if } n = 0, \\ (1-z)e^{z+\frac{z^{2}}{2}+\cdots+\frac{z^{n}}{n}} & \text{if } n \neq 0. \end{cases}
    \]
    If $f(z)$ is an entire function then it admits a factorization in terms of its zeros and the elementary factors. This is called the \textbf{Weierstrass factorization}\index{Weierstrass factorization} of $f(z)$:

    \begin{theorem*}[Weierstrass factorization]
      Let $f(z)$ be an entire function with $\{a_{n}\}_{n \ge 1}$ the nonzero zeros of $f(z)$ counted with multiplicity. Also suppose that $f(z)$ has a zero of order $m$ at $z = 0$ where it is understood that if $m = 0$ we mean $f(0) \neq 0$ and if $m < 0$ we mean $f(z)$ has a pole of order $|m|$ at $z = 0$. Then there exists an entire function $g(z)$ and sequence of nonnegative integers $(p_{n})_{n \ge 1}$ such that
      \[
        f(z) = z^{m}e^{g(z)}\prod_{n \ge 1}E_{p_{n}}\left(\frac{z}{a_{n}}\right).
      \]
    \end{theorem*}

    The Weierstrass factorization of $f(z)$ can be strengthened if $f(z)$ does not grow too fast. We say $f(z)$ is of \textbf{finite order}\index{finite order} if there exists a $\rho_{0} > 0$ such that
    \[
      f(z) \ll e^{|z|^{\rho_{0}}},
    \]
    for all $z \in \C$. The \textbf{order}\index{order} $\rho$ of $f(z)$ is the infimum of the $\rho_{0}$. Let $q = \lf \rho \rf$. If there is no such $\rho_{0}$, $f(z)$ is said to be of \textbf{infinite order}\index{infinite order} and we set $\rho = q = \infty$. Let $\{a_{n}\}_{n \ge 1}$ be the nonzero zeros of $f(z)$ that are not zero and ordered such that $a_{n} \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ if there are infinitely many zeros. Then we define the \textbf{rank}\index{rank} of $f(z)$ to be the smallest positive integer $p$ such that the series
    \[
      \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{1}{|a_{n}|^{p+1}},
    \]
    converges. If there is no such integer we set $p = \infty$ and if there are finitely many zeros we set $p = 0$. We set $g = \max(p,q)$ and call $g$ the \textbf{genus}\index{genus} of $f(z)$. We can now state the \textbf{Hadamard factorization}\index{Hadamard factorization} of $f(z)$:

    \begin{theorem*}[Hadamard factorization]
      Let $f(z)$ be an entire function of finite order $\rho$. If $p$ is the rank and $g$ is the genus then $g \le \rho$. Moreover, let $\{a_{n}\}_{n \ge 1}$ be the nonzero zeros of $f(z)$ counted with multiplicity and suppose that $f(z)$ has a zero of order $m$ at $z = 0$ where it is understood that if $m = 0$ we mean $f(0) \neq 0$ and if $m < 0$ we mean $f(z)$ has a pole of order $|m|$ at $z = 0$. Then there exists a polynomial $Q(z)$ of degree at most $q$ such that
      \[
        f(z) = z^{m}e^{Q(z)}\prod_{n \ge 1}E_{p}\left(\frac{z}{a_{n}}\right).
      \]
      Moreover, the sum
      \[
        \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{1}{|a_{n}|^{\rho+\e}},
      \]
      converges.
    \end{theorem*}
  \section{The Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of Convexity Principle}\label{append:The_Phragmen_Lindelof_Convexity_principle}
    The \textbf{Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of convexity principle}\index{Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of convexity principle} is a generic name for extending the maximum modulus principle to unbounded regions. The \textbf{Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of convexity principle}\index{Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of convexity principle} for vertical strips is the case when the unbounded region is the vertical strip $a < \s < b$:

    \begin{theorem*}[Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of convexity principle, vertical strip]\label{thm:Phragmen-Lindelof_convexity_principle}
      Suppose $f(s)$ is a holomorphic function on an open neighborhood of the vertical strip $a < \s < b$ such that $f(s) \ll e^{|s|^{A}}$ for some $A \ge 0$. Then the following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item If $|f(s)| \le M$ for $\s = a,b$, that is on the boundary edges of the strip then $|f(s)| \le M$ for all $s$ in the strip.
        \item Assume that there is a continuous function $g(t)$ such that
        \[
          f(a+it) \ll g(t)^{\a} \quad \text{and} \quad f(b+it) \ll g(t)^{\b},
        \]
        for all $t \in \R$. Then
        \[
          f(s) \ll g(t)^{\a\ell(\s)+\b(1-\ell(\s))},
        \]
        where $\ell$ is the linear function such that $\ell(a) = 1$ and $\ell(b) = 0$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem*}

    We will also need a variant. The \textbf{Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of convexity principle}\index{Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of convexity principle} for vertical half-strips is the case when the unbounded region is the vertical half-strip $a < \s < b$ with $t > c$:

    \begin{theorem*}[Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of convexity principle, vertical half-strip]\label{thm:Phragmen-Lindelof_convexity_principle_half-strip}
      Suppose $f(s)$ is a holomorphic function on an open neighborhood of the vertical strip $a < \s < b$ with $t > c$ such that \\ $f(s) \ll e^{|s|^{A}}$ for some $A \ge 0$. Then the following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item If $|f(s)| \le M$ for $\s = a,b$ with $t \ge c$ and $t = c$ with $a \le \s \le b$, that is on the boundary edges of the half-strip then $|f(s)| \le M$ for all $s$ in the strip.
        \item Assume that there is a continuous function $g(t)$ such that
        \[
          f(a+it) \ll g(t)^{\a} \quad \text{and} \quad f(b+it) \ll g(t)^{\b},
        \]
        for all $t \ge c$. Then
        \[
          f(s) \ll g(t)^{\a\ell(\s)+\b(1-\ell(\s))},
        \]
        where $\ell$ is the linear function such that $\ell(a) = 1$ and $\ell(b) = 0$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem*}
  \section{Bessel Functions}\label{append:Bessel_Functions}
    For any $\nu \in \C$, the \textbf{Bessel equation}\index{Bessel equation} is the ODE
    \[
      z^{2}\frac{d^{2}w}{dz^{2}}+z\frac{dw}{dz}+(z^{2}-\nu^{2})w = 0.
    \]
    There are two linearly independent solutions to this equation. One solution is the \textbf{Bessel function of the first kind}\index{Bessel function of the first kind} $J_{\nu}(z)$ defined by
    \[
      J_{\nu}(z) = \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!\G(n+\nu+1)}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^{2n+\nu}.
    \]
    For integers $n$, $J_{n}(z)$ is entire and we have
    \[
      J_{n}(z) = (-1)^{n}J_{-n}(z).
    \]
    Otherwise, $J_{\nu}(z)$ has a pole at $z = 0$ and $J_{\nu}(z)$ and $J_{-\nu}(z)$ are linearly independent solutions to the Bessel equation. The other solution is the \textbf{Bessel function of the second kind}\index{Bessel function of the second kind} $Y_{\nu}(z)$ defined by
    \[
      Y_{\nu}(z) = \frac{J_{\nu}(z)\cos(\nu\pi)-J_{-\nu}(z)}{\sin(\nu\pi)},
    \]
    for non-integers $\nu$, and for integers $n$ is
    \[
      Y_{n}(z) = \lim_{\nu \to n}Y_{\nu}(z).
    \]
    For any integer $n$, we also have
    \[
      Y_{n}(z) = (-1)^{n}Y_{-n}(z).
    \]
    For the $J$-Bessel function there is also an important integral representation called the \textbf{Schl\"aflin integral representation}\index{Schl\"aflin integral representation}:

    \begin{proposition*}[Schl\"aflin integral representation for the $J$-Bessel function]
      For any $\nu \in \C$,
      \[
        J_{\nu}(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^{\nu}\int_{-\infty}^{(0^{+})}\frac{e^{t-\frac{z^{2}}{4t}}}{t^{\nu+1}}\,dt,
      \]
      provided $|\arg(z)| < \frac{\pi}{2}$ and where the contour is the Hankel contour about the negative real axis.
    \end{proposition*}

    The \textbf{modified Bessel equation}\index{modified Bessel equation} is the ODE
    \[
      z^{2}\frac{d^{2}w}{dz^{2}}+z\frac{dw}{dz}-(z^{2}+\nu^{2})w = 0.
    \]
    Like the Bessel equation, there are two linearly independent solutions. One solution is the \textbf{modified Bessel function of the first kind}\index{Bessel function of the first kind} $I_{\nu}(x)$ given by
    \[
      I_{\nu}(z) = i^{-\nu}J_{\nu}(iz) = \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{1}{n!\G(n+\nu+1)}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^{2n+\nu}.
    \]
    For $n \in \Z$, this solution is symmetric in $n$ which we express as
    \[
      I_{n}(z) = I_{-n}(z).
    \]
    We also have a useful integral representation:

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:integral_representation_I-Bessel_function}
      For any $\nu \in \C$,
      \[
        I_{\nu}(z) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}e^{z\cos(t)}\cos(\nu t)\,dt-\frac{\sin(\nu\pi)}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-z\cosh(t)-\nu t}\,dt,
      \]
      provided $|\arg(z)| < \frac{\pi}{2}$.
    \end{proposition}

    From this integral representation we can show the following asymptotic:

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem:I_Bessel_function_asymptotic}
      For any $\nu \in \C$,
      \[
        I_{\nu}(z) \sim_{\e} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi z}}e^{z},
      \]
      provided $|\arg(z)| \le \frac{\pi}{2}-\e$.
    \end{lemma}

    The other solution is the \textbf{modified Bessel function of the second kind}\index{modified Bessel function of the second kind} $K_{\nu}(z)$ defined by
    \[
      K_{\nu}(z) = \frac{\pi}{2}\frac{I_{-\nu}(z)-I_{\nu}(z)}{\sin(\nu\pi)},
    \]
    for non-integers $\nu$, and for integers $n$ is
    \[
      K_{n}(z)= \lim_{\nu \to n}K_{\nu}(z).
    \]
    This is one of the more important types of Bessel functions as they appear in the Fourier coefficients of certain Eisenstein series. This function is symmetric in $\nu$ (even when $\nu$ is an integer) which we express as
    \[
      K_{\nu}(z) = K_{-\nu}(z).
    \]
    We also have a useful integral representation:

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:integral_representation_K-Bessel_function}
      For any $\nu \in \C$,
      \[
        K_{\nu}(z) = \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-z\cosh(t)}\cosh(\nu t)\,dt,
      \]
      provided $|\arg(z)| < \frac{\pi}{2}$.
    \end{proposition}

    From this integral representation it does not take much to show the following asymptotic:

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem:K_Bessel_function_asymptotic}
      For any $\nu \in \C$,
      \[
        K_{\nu}(z) \sim_{\e} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2z}}e^{-z},
      \]
      provided $|\arg(z)| \le \frac{\pi}{2}-\e$.
    \end{lemma}
  \section{Whittaker Functions}\label{append:Whittaker_Functions}
    For $\k,\mu \in \C$, the \textbf{Whittaker equation}\index{Whittaker equation} is the ODE
    \[
      \frac{dw}{dz}+\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{\k}{z}-\frac{\frac{1}{4}-\mu^{2}}{z^{2}}\right)w = 0.
    \]
    There are two linearly independent solutions to this equation provided $-2\mu \notin \Z_{+}$. If we additionally assume that $w(z) = o(e^{2\pi y})$ as $y \to \infty$ then there is only one linearly independent solution. This solution is the \textbf{Whittaker function}\index{Whittaker function} $W_{\k,\mu}(z)$. It can be expressed in the form
    \[
      W_{\k,\mu}(z) = z^{\mu+\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\frac{z}{2}}U\left(\mu-\k+\frac{1}{2},1+2\mu,z\right),
    \]
    where $U(\a,\b,z)$ is the \textbf{confluent hypergeometric function}\index{confluent hypergeometric function} initially defined by
    \[
      U(\a,\b,z) = \frac{1}{\G(\a)}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-zu}u^{\a-1}(1+u)^{\b-\a-1}\,du,
    \]
    for $\Re(\a) > 0$ and $x > 0$, and then by analytic continuation to $\C^{3}$. From this integral representation we can show the following asymptotic:

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem:Whittaker_function_asymptotic}
      For any $\k,\mu \in \C$ with $-2\mu \notin \Z_{+}$,
      \[
        W_{\k,\mu}(z) \sim_{\e} z^{\k}e^{-\frac{z}{2}},
      \]
      provided $|\arg(z)| \le \frac{\pi}{2}-\e$.
    \end{lemma}

    The Whittaker function also satisfies the important symmetry properties
    \[
      W_{\k,\mu}(z) = W_{\k,-\mu}(z) \quad \text{and} \quad \conj{W_{\k,\mu}(z)} = W_{\conj{\k},\conj{\mu}}(\conj{z}).
    \]
    In particular, $W_{\k,\mu}(z)$ is conjugate symmetric if $\k$ and $z$ are both real and $\mu$ is either real or purely imaginary. The Whittaker function also has a simplified form in special cases:
    
    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:Whittaker_special_cases}
      For any $\nu,\a \in \C$ with $-2\nu \notin \Z_{+}$,
      \[
        W_{0,\nu}(z) = \left(\frac{z}{\pi}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}K_{\nu}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad W_{\a,\a-\frac{1}{2}}(z) = z^{\a}e^{-\frac{z}{2}}.
      \]
    \end{theorem}
  \section{Lattice Sums}
    Consider $\R^{d}$ with the standard inner product $\<\cdot,\cdot\>$ and norm $\|\cdot\|$. We are often interested in series that are obtained by summing over the lattice $\Z^{d} \subset \R^{d}$. In particular, we have the following general result:

    \begin{theorem}
      Let $d \ge 1$ be an integer. Then
      \[
        \sum_{\mathbf{a} \in \Z^{d}-\{\mathbf{0}\}}\frac{1}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^{s}},
      \]
      is locally absolutely uniformly convergent in the region $\s > d$.
    \end{theorem}

    In a practical setting, we usually restrict to the case $d = 2$. In this setting, with a little more work can show a more useful result:

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:general_lattice_sum_convergence_for_two_variables}
      Let $z \in \H$. Then
      \[
        \sum_{(n,m) \in \Z^{2}-\{\mathbf{0}\}}\frac{1}{|nz+m|^{s}},
      \]
      is locally absolutely uniformly convergent in the region $\s > 2$. In addition, it is locally absolutely uniformly convergent as a function of $z$ provided $\s > 2$.
    \end{proposition}

  \section{Finitely Generated Modules Over Principal Ideal Domains}
    Let $M$ be a finitely generated module over a principal ideal domain $R$. The following result is the \textbf{structure theorem for finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains}\index{structure theorem for finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains}:

    \begin{theorem*}[Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains]
      \phantom{} \\
      Let $M$ be a finitely generated module over a principal ideal domain $R$. Then
      \[
        M \cong R^{n} \op R/d_{1}M \op \cdots \op R/d_{t}R,
      \]
      for a unique $n \ge 0$ and $d_{i} \in R$ for $1 \le i \le t$ such that
      \[
        d_{t}R \subset d_{t-1}R \subset \cdots \subset d_{1}R. 
      \]
    \end{theorem*}

    In the special case that $M$ is a finitely generated abelian group, we obtain the \textbf{structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups}\index{structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups}:

    \begin{theorem*}[Structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups]
      Let $M$ be a finitely generated abelian group. Then
      \[
        M \cong \Z^{n} \op \Z/k_{1}\Z \op \cdots \op \Z/k_{t}\Z,
      \]
      for a unique $n \ge 0$ and $k_{i} \in \Z$ such that $k_{i} \mid k_{i+1}$ for $1 \le i \le t-1$.
    \end{theorem*}

    In particular, any subgroup of a free abelian group $M$ of rank $n$ is also free abelian and has rank at most $n$. If $N \le M$ is a subgroup of rank $n$ then the quotient is also finite:

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:base_change_quotient_determinant}
      Let $M$ be a free abelian group of rank $n$ and suppose $N \le M$ is a subgroup that is also a free abelian group of rank $n$. Then $|M/N|$ is finite and
      \[
        |M/N| = |\det(A)|,
      \]
      for any base change matrix $A$ from a basis of $M$ to a basis of $N$.
    \end{proposition}
  \section{Galois Theory}\label{append:Galois Theory}
    Let $E/F$ be an algebraic extension. We say that $E/F$ is \textbf{Galois}\index{Galois} if it is both normal and separable. Actually, there are several equivalent conditions for $E/F$ to be Galois provided $E/F$ is finite:

    \begin{proposition}
      Let $E/F$ be a finite extension. Then the following are equivalent:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item $E/F$ is Galois.
        \item $E$ is the splitting field of some polynomial in $F[x]$.
        \item $|\Aut_{F}(E)| = |E/F|$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{proposition}

    If $E/F$ is Galois, we define \textbf{Galois group}\index{Galois group} $\Gal(E/F)$ by
    \[
      \Gal(E/F) = \Aut_{F}(E).
    \]
    In other words, $\Gal(E/F)$ is the group of automorphism of $E$ that fix $F$ pointwise. Now if $H$ is a subgroup of $\Gal(E/F)$, we define the \textbf{fixed field}\index{fixed field} $E^{H}$ of $E$ by $H$ to be
    \[
      E^{H} = \{\a \in E:\text{$\s(\a) = \a$ for all $\s \in H$}\}.
    \] 
    In other words, $E^{H}$ is the intermediate field of $E/F$ that consists of those elements that are fixed pointwise by every automorphism in $H$. If $E/F$ is finite, say of degree $n$, then being separable means the primitive element theorem applies and so $E = F(\t)$ for some $\t \in E$. The minimal polynomial $m_{\t}(x)$ of $\t$ over $F$ is necessarily of degree $n$ and $\t$ has $n$ conjugates $\t_{1},\ldots,\t_{n}$, with say $\t_{1} = \t$, which are the roots of $m_{\t}(x)$. The automorphisms of $\Gal(E/F)$ are then the induced by mapping $\t$ to one of its conjugates $\t_{1},\ldots,\t_{n}$. The most important result of Galois theory is the \textbf{fundamental theorem of Galois theory}\index{fundamental theorem of Galois theory} which relates intermediate fields of $E/F$ to subgroups of the Galois group provided $E/F$ is finite:

    \begin{theorem}[Fundamental theorem of Galois theory]
      Let $E/F$ be a finite Galois extension and let $K$ be an intermediate field. Then $E/K$ is Galois. Moreover, the maps
      \[
        K \to \Gal(E/K) \quad \text{and} \quad H \to E^{H},
      \]
      are inclusion-reversing bijections between the intermediate fields of $E/F$ and the subgroups of $\Gal(E/F)$. We have
      \[
        \frac{|\Gal(E/F)|}{|H|} = |E^{H}/F|.
      \]
      In addition, $E^{H}/F$ is Galois if and only if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $\Gal(E/F)$ and in this case there is an isomorphism
      \[
        \Gal(E^{H}/F) \cong \Gal(E/F)/H.
      \]
    \end{theorem}

    Galois groups also behave nicely with respect to composite fields:

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:Galois_linearly_disjoint}
      Let $E_{1}/F$ and $E_{2}/F$ be finite Galois extensions and let $E$ be the composite of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$. Then $E/F$ is Galois. Moreover, $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are linearly disjoint over $F$ in $\conj{F}$ if and only if $E_{1} \cap E_{2} = F$.
    \end{proposition}
  \section{Character Groups}\label{append:Character_Groups}
    For any finite abelian group $G$, a \textbf{character}\index{character} $\chi$ is a homomorphism $\chi:G \to \C$. They form a group, denoted $\what{G}$, under multiplication called the \textbf{character group}\index{character group} of $G$. If $G$ is an additive group, we say that any $\chi \in \G$ is a \textbf{additive character}\index{additive character}. Similarly, if $G$ is a multiplicative group, we say that any $\chi \in \G$ is a \textbf{multiplicative character}\index{multiplicative character}. In any case, if $|G| = n$ then $\chi(g)^{n} = \chi(g^{n}) = 1$ so that $\chi$ takes values in the $n$-th roots of unity. Moreover, to every character $\chi$ there is its \textbf{conjugate character}\index{conjugate character} $\conj{\chi}$ defined by $\conj{\chi}(g) = \conj{\chi(a)}$. Clearly the conjugate character is also a character. Since $\chi$ takes its value in the roots of unity, $\conj{\chi(a)} = \chi(a)^{-1}$ so that $\conj{\chi} = \chi^{-1}$. One of the central theorems about characters is that the character group of $G$ is isomorphic to $G$:

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:character_group_isomorphim}
      Any finite abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to its character group. That is,
      \[
        G \cong \what{G}.
      \]
      In particular, if $G$ is finite then there are $|G|$ many characters of $G$.
    \end{proposition}

    The characters also satisfy certain \textbf{orthogonality relations}\index{orthogonality relations}:

    \begin{proposition*}[Orthogonality relations]
      Let $G$ be a finite abelian group.
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item For any two characters $\chi$ and $\psi$ of $G$,
        \[
          \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}\chi(g)\conj{\psi}(g) = \d_{\chi,\psi}.
        \]
        \item For any $g,h \in G$,
        \[
          \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{\chi \in \what{G}}\chi(g)\cchi(h) = \d_{g,h}.
        \]
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{proposition*}
  \section{Representation Theory}\label{append:Representation_Theory}
    Let $G$ be a group, $F$ be a field, and $V$ be an $F$-vector space. A \textbf{representation}\index{representation} $\rho$ of $G$ on $V$ is a map
    \[
      \rho:G \x V \to V \qquad (g,v) \mapsto \rho(g,v) = g \cdot v,
    \]
    such that the following properties are satisfied:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item For any $g \in G$, the map
      \[
        \rho:V \to V \qquad v \mapsto g \cdot v,
      \]
      is linear.
      \item For any $g,h \in G$ and $v \in V$,
      \[
        1 \cdot v = v \quad \text{and} \quad g \cdot (h \cdot v) = (gh) \cdot v.
      \]
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore $\rho$ defines an action of $G$ on $V$. An equivalent definition of a representation of $G$ on $V$ is a homomorphism from $G$ into $\Aut(V)$. We also denote this homomorphism by $\rho$. If the dimension of $V$ is $n$ then $\rho$ is said to be \textbf{n-dimensional}\index{n-dimensional}. We say that $(\rho,W)$ is a \textbf{subrepresentation}\index{subrepresentation} of $(V,\rho)$ if $W \subseteq V$ is a $G$-invariant subspace. In particular, $(\rho,W)$ is a representation itself. Lastly, if $(\rho_{1},V_{1})$ and $(\rho_{2},V_{2})$ are two representations, we can form the \textbf{direct sum representation}\index{direct sum representation} $(\rho_{1} \op \rho_{2},V_{1} \op V_{2})$ where $\rho_{1} \op \rho_{2}$ acts diagonally on $V_{1} \op V_{2}$. A natural question to ask is how representation can be decomposed as a direct sum of other representations. We say $\rho$ is \textbf{irreducible}\index{irreducible} if it contains no proper $G$-invariant subspaces and is \textbf{completely irreducible}\index{completely irreducible} if it decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations.

    We will only need one very useful theorem about representations when $G$ is a finite abelian group and $V$ is a complex vector space. In this case $G$ has a group of characters $\what{G}$, and the underlying complex vector space $V$ is completely reducible with respect to the characters of $G$:

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:finite_abelian_representation_is_completely_reducible}
      Let $V$ be a complex vector space and let $\Phi$ be a representation of a group $G$ on $V$. If $G$ is a finite abelian group then
      \[
        V = \bigop_{\chi \in \what{G}}V_{\chi},
      \]
      where
      \[
        V_{\chi} = \{v \in V:g \cdot v = \chi(g)v \text{ for all } g \in G\}.
      \]
      In particular, $V$ is completely reducible and every irreducible subrepresentation is $1$-dimensional.
    \end{theorem}
\chapter{Topology}
  \section{Fundamental Domains}\label{append:Fundamental_Domains}
    Let $G$ be a group acting on a connected Hausdorff space $X$ by automorphisms. Then we can consider the quotient space $G\backslash X$ of $X$ by the action of $G$. We would like the quotient $G\backslash X$ to inherit properties of $G$. For this, we require $G$ to satisfy two properties. The first is that $G$ is a discrete group. For the second, we say $G$ acts \textbf{properly discontinuously}\index{properly discontinuously} if for every $x \in X$ there exists a neighborhood $U_{x}$ of $x$ such that the intersection $gU_{x} \cap U_{x}$ is empty for all $g \in G$ unless $g$ is the identity. In the case $G$ is discrete and acts properly discontinuously, the quotient $G\backslash X$ inherits nice topological properties:

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:quotient_by_discrete_property_discontinuously}
      Let $G$ be a group acting on a a connected Hausdorff space $X$ by automorphisms. If $G$ is discrete and acts properly discontinuously then $G\backslash X$ is also a connected Hausdorff space.
    \end{proposition}

    In the case of \cref{prop:quotient_by_discrete_property_discontinuously}, we often want to consider a useful set of representatives of $G\backslash X$. A \textbf{fundamental domain}\index{fundamental domain} for $G\backslash X$ is a closed subset $D \subseteq X$ satisfying the following conditions:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=(\roman*)]
        \item Any point in $X$ is $G$-equivalent to a point in $D$.
        \item No two distinct points in the interior of $D$ are $G$-equivalent.
      \end{enumerate}
      In other words, $D$ is a complete set of representatives (possibly with overlap on the boundary) for $G\backslash X$ that has a nice topological structure with respect to $X$. Note that if $D$ is a fundamental domain then so is $gD$ for any $g \in G$ and moreover
      \[
        X = \bigcup_{g \in G}gD.
      \]
      In particular, the choice of fundamental domain is not unique. Intuitively, a fundamental domain is a geometric realization of $G\backslash X$ which is often more fruitful than thinking of $G\backslash X$ as an abstract set of equivalence classes. Indeed, if $X$ is a subset of $\R^{n}$ or $\C^{n}$ then being closed ensures that we can integrate over $D$ as this set will be measurable.
