\chapter{Explicit Formulas \& Prime Number Theorems}
  Our main aim is to prove the prime number theorem and its variant for primes restricted to a certain residue class, the Siegel–Walfisz theorem, in the classical manner. These results will follow from explicit formulas for the Chebyshev function $\psi(x)$ and a sutiable generalization in the latter case. After deriving these results, we prove (for the second time) the prime number theorem and the Siegel–Walfisz theorem.

      The explicit formula for $\psi(x)$ will be obtained by applying truncated Perron's formula. Since $\psi(x)$ is discontinuous when $x$ is a prime power, we need to work with $\psi_{0}(x)$ to apply the Mellin inversion formula. The \textbf{explicit formula}\index{explicit formula} for $\psi(x)$ is the following:

      \begin{theorem}[Explicit formula for $\psi(x)$]
        For $x \ge 2$,
        \[
          \psi_{0}(x) = x-\sum_{\rho}\frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho}-\frac{\z'}{\z}(0)-\frac{1}{2}\log(1-x^{-2}),
        \]
        where $\rho$ runs over the nontrivial zeros of $\z(s)$ counted with multiplicity and ordered with respect to the size of the ordinate.
      \end{theorem}

      A few comments are in order before we prove the explicit formula for $\psi(x)$. First, since $\rho$ is conjectured to be of the form $\rho = \frac{1}{2}+i\g$ under the Riemann hypothesis, $x$ contributes the main term in the explicit formula. This is in agreement with the fact that $\psi(x) \sim x$ which is equivalent to the prime number theorem as we already showed. The value $\frac{\z'}{\z}(0)$ can be shown to be $\log(2\pi)$ (see \cite{davenport1980multiplicative} for a proof). Also, using the Taylor series of the logarithm, the last term can be expressed as
      \[
        \frac{1}{2}\log(1-x^{-2}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k \ge 1}(-1)^{k-1}\frac{(-x^{-2})^{k}}{k} = \sum_{k \ge 1}(-1)^{2k-1}\frac{x^{-2k}}{2k} = -\sum_{\w}\frac{x^{\w}}{\w},
      \]
      where $\w$ runs over the trivial zeros of $\z(s)$. We will now prove the explicit formula for $\psi(x)$:

      \begin{proof}[Proof of the explicit formula for $\psi(x)$]
        Recalling \cref{equ:Drichlet_series_log_derivative_zeta} and that $\psi(x) = \sum_{n \le x}\L(n)$, applying truncated Perron's formula to $-\frac{\z'}{\z}(s)$ gives
        \begin{equation}\label{equ:explicit_formula_proof_1}
          |\psi_{0}(x)-J(x,T)| \ll x^{c}\sum_{\substack{n \ge 1 \\ n \neq x}}\frac{\L(n)}{n^{c}}\min\left(1,\frac{1}{T\left|\log\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\right|}\right)+\d_{x}\L(x)\frac{c}{T},
        \end{equation}
        where
        \[
          J(x,T) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-iT}^{c+iT}-\frac{\z'}{\z}(s)x^{s}\,\frac{ds}{s},
        \]
        $c > 1$, and it is understood that $\d_{x} = 0$ unless $x$ is a prime power. We will take $T > 1$ and $c = 1+\log(x)^{-1}$ so that $x^{c} = ex$. The first step is to estimate the right-hand side of \cref{equ:explicit_formula_proof_1}. First, we deal with the terms corresponding to $n$ such that $n$ is boudned away from $x$. So suppose $n \le \frac{3}{4}x$ or $n \ge \frac{5}{4}x$. For these $n$, $1 \ll \log\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)$ so that their contribution is
        \[
          \ll \todo{xxx}
        \]
      \end{proof}
