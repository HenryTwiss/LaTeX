\chapter{Types of \texorpdfstring{$L$}{L}-functions}
  We discuss a variety of $L$-functions: the Riemann zeta function, $L$-functions attached to Dirichlet characters, and Hecke $L$-functions. In the case of Hecke $L$-functions, we also describe a method of Rankin and Selberg for constructing new $L$-functions from old ones.
  \section{The Riemann Zeta Function}
    \subsection*{The Definition \& Euler Product of \texorpdfstring{$\z(s)$}{\z(s)}}
      The \textbf{Riemann zeta function}\index{Riemann zeta function} or simply the \textbf{zeta function}\index{zeta function} $\z(s)$ is defined as an $L$-series:
      \[
        \z(s) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{1}{n^{s}}.
      \]
      This is the prototypical example of a Dirichlet series as all the coefficients are $1$. We will see that $\z(s)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function. As the coefficients are trivially polynomially bounded, $\z(s)$ is locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1$. Also note that $\z(s)$ is necessiarly nonzero in this region. Determining the Euler product is also an easy matter. As the coefficients are obviously completely multiplicative, we have the degree $1$ Euler product
      \[
        \z(s) = \prod_{p}(1-p^{-s})^{-1},
      \]
      in this region as well. The local factor at $p$ is $\z_{p}(s) = (1-p^{-s})^{-1}$ with local root $1$.
    \subsection*{The Integral Representation of \texorpdfstring{$\z(s)$}{\z(s)}: Part I}
      Riemann's ingenious insight was to analytically continue $\z(s)$. By this, he sought to find a representation of $\z(s)$ defined on a larger region than $\Re(s) > 1$. This is the approach we will take, and the argument follows the same line of reasoning as that of Riemann. We consider the gamma function $\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)$:
      \[
        \G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right) = \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x}x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}.
      \]

      \begin{remark}
        We have chosen to express the gamma function in terms of the measure $\frac{dx}{x}$ instead of $dx$. This is a tactical change for two reasons. The first is that $\frac{dx}{x}$ is invariant under the change of variables $x \to Cx$ for any constant $C$. The second is that under the change of variables $x \to \frac{1}{x}$ we have $\frac{dx}{x} \to -\frac{dx}{x}$ but the bounds of integration are also flipped. So we may leave the measure invariant provided we dont flip the bounds of integration. These types of change of variables are essential in the study of $L$-functions which motivates the use of this measure.
      \end{remark}

      Performing the change of variables $x \to \pi n^{2}x$ for fixed $n \ge 1$ yields
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:gamma_integral_substitution}
        \G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right) = \pi^{\frac{s}{2}} n^{s}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\pi n^{2}x}x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}.
      \end{equation}
      Dividing by $\pi^{\frac{s}{2}}n^{s}$ and summing over $n \ge 1$, we see that for $\Re(s) > 1$,
      \begin{align*}
        \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\z(s) &= \sum_{n \ge 1}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\pi n^{2}x}x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} \\
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\sum_{n \ge 1}e^{-\pi n^{2}x}x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} && \text{DCT} \\
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x},
      \end{align*}
      where we set
      \[
        \w(x) = \sum_{n \ge 1}e^{-\pi n^{2}x}.
      \]
      Therefore we have an integral representation
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:integral_representation_zeta_1}
        \z(s) = \frac{\pi^{\frac{s}{2}}}{\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}.
      \end{equation}
      This was essentially Riemann's insight: rewrite the Riemann zeta function in terms of a Mellin transform. Unfortunately, we cannot proceed until we understand $\w(x)$. So we will make a slight detour and come back to the integral representation after.
    \subsection*{Jacobi's Theta Function \texorpdfstring{$\vt(s)$}{\vt(s)}}
      \textbf{Jacobi's theta function}\index{Jacobi's theta function} $\vt(s)$ is defined for $\Re(s) > 0$ by
      \[
        \vt(s) = \sum_{n \in \Z}e^{-\pi n^{2}s} = 1+2\sum_{n \ge 1}e^{-\pi n^{2}s}.
      \]
      It is locally absolutely uniformly convergent in this region by the ratio test. It's relation to $\w(s)$ is the identity
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:omega_theta_relationship_for_zeta}
        \w(s) = \frac{\vt(s)-1}{2}.
      \end{equation}
      The essential fact about Jacobi's theta function we will need is the \textbf{functional equation for Jacobi's theta funtion}\index{functional equation for Jacobi's theta funtion} that was known to Riemann:

      \begin{theorem}[Functional equation for Jacobi's theta function]
        For $\Re(s) > 0$,
        \[
          \vt(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}\vt\left(\frac{1}{s}\right).
        \]
      \end{theorem}
      \begin{proof}
        By the identity theorem it suffices to prove this on a set containg a limit point. We will prove this on the right-half of the real line, so take $s$ real with $s > 0$. Set $f(x) = e^{-\pi x^{2}s}$. Then $f(x)$ is a Schwarz function. We compute its Fourier transform:
        \[
          \hat{f}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-2\pi itx}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi x^{2}s}e^{-2\pi itx}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi(x^{2}s+2itx)}\,dx.
        \]
        Making the change of variables $x \to \frac{x}{\sqrt{s}}$, the last integral above becomes
        \[
          \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi\left(x^{2}+\frac{2itx}{\sqrt{s}}\right)}.
        \]
        Complete the square in the exponent by noticing
        \[
          -\pi\left(x^{2}+\frac{2itx}{\sqrt{s}}\right) = -\pi\left(\left(x+\frac{it}{\sqrt{s}}\right)^{2}+\frac{t^{2}}{s^{2}}\right).
        \]
        Taking exponentials, this implies that the previous integral is equal to
        \[
          \frac{e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{s}}}{\sqrt{s}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi\left(x+\frac{it}{\sqrt{s}}\right)^{2}}\,dx.
        \]
        The change of variables $x \to \frac{x}{\sqrt{s}}-\frac{it}{\sqrt{s}}$ is permitted without affecting the line of integration by viewing the integral as a complex integral, noting that the integrand is entire as a complex function, and shifting the line of integration. This gives
        \[
          \frac{e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{s}}}{\sqrt{s}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi\left(x+\frac{it}{\sqrt{s}}\right)^{2}}\,dx = \frac{e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{s}}}{\sqrt{s}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi x^{2}}\,dx = \frac{e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{s}}}{\sqrt{s}},
        \]
        where the last equality follows because the last integral above is $1$ since it is the Gaussian integral (see \cref{append:Special_Integrals}). The Poisson summation formula and the identity theorem together finish the proof.
      \end{proof}

      This completes our interest in Jacobi's theta function.
    \subsection*{The Integral Representation of \texorpdfstring{$\z(s)$}{\z(s)}: Part II}
      Returning to the Riemann zeta function, we split the integral in \cref{equ:integral_representation_zeta_1} into two pieces
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:symmetric_integral_zeta_split}
        \int_{0}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} = \int_{0}^{1}\w(x)x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}+\int_{1}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}.
      \end{equation}
      Since $\w(x)$ has exponential decay as $x \to \infty$, the second piece is locally absolutely uniformly bounded for $\Re(s) > 1$ by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. Hence it is analytic there. The idea now is to rewrite the first piece in the same form and symmetrize the result as much as possible. We being by performing a change of variables $x \to \frac{1}{x}$ to the first piece to obtain
      \[
        \int_{1}^{\infty}\w\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)x^{-\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}
      \]
      Now the functional equation for Jacobi's theta function $\vt(x)$ and \cref{equ:omega_theta_relationship_for_zeta} together imply
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:piece_one_zeta_1}
        \w\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\vt\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)-1}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{x}\vt(x)-1}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{x}(2\w(x)+1)-1}{2} = \sqrt{x}\w(x)+\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}-\frac{1}{2}.
      \end{equation}
      \cref{equ:piece_one_zeta_1} gives the first equality in the following chain:
      \begin{align*}
        \int_{1}^{\infty}\w\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)x^{-\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} &= \int_{1}^{\infty}\left(\sqrt{x}\w(x)+\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right)x^{-\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} \\
        &= \int_{1}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{1-s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}+\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{\frac{1-s}{2}}}{2}\,\frac{dx}{x}-\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{-\frac{s}{2}}}{2}\,\frac{dx}{x} \\
        &= \int_{1}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{1-s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}+\frac{1}{1-s}-\frac{1}{s} \\
        &= \int_{1}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{1-s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}-\frac{1}{s(1-s)}.
      \end{align*}
      Substituting this result back into \cref{equ:symmetric_integral_zeta_split} with \cref{equ:integral_representation_zeta_1} yields the integral representation
      \[
        \z(s) = \frac{\pi^{\frac{s}{2}}}{\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)}\left[-\frac{1}{s(1-s)}+\int_{1}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{1-s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}+\int_{1}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}\right].
      \]
      This integral representation will give analytic continuation. To see this, first observe that everything outside the backets is entire. Moreover, the two integrals are locally absolutely uniformly bounded on $\C$ by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. The fractional term is holomorphic except for simple poles at $s = 0$ and $s = 1$. The meromorphic continuation to $\C$ follows with possible simple poles at $s = 0$ and $s = 1$. There is no pole at $s = 0$. Indeed, $\g(s,\z)$ has a simple pole coming from the gamma factor there and so its reciprocal has a simple zero. This cancels the corresponding simple pole of $\frac{1}{s(1-s)}$ so that $\z(s)$ has a removable singularity and thus is holomorphic at $s = 0$. At $s = 1$, $\g(s,\z)$ is nonzero, and so $\z(s)$ has a simple pole. Therefore $\z(s)$ has meromorphic continuation to all of $\C$ with a simple pole at $s = 1$. 
    \subsection*{The Functional Equation, Critical Strip \& Residue of \texorpdfstring{$\z(s)$}{\z(s)}}
      An immediate consequence of applying the symmetry $s \to 1-s$ to the integral representation is the following functional equation:
      \[
        \frac{\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)}{\pi^{\frac{s}{2}}}\z(s) = \frac{\G\left(\frac{1-s}{2}\right)}{\pi^{\frac{1-s}{2}}}\z(1-s).
      \]
      We identify the gamma factor as
      \[
        \g(s,\z) = \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right),
      \]
      with $\k = 0$ the only local root at infinity. Clearly it satisfies the required bounds. The conductor is $q(\z) = 1$ so no primes ramify. The completed zeta function is
      \[
        \L(s,\z) = \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\z(s),
      \]
      with functional equation
      \[
        \L(s,\z) = \L(1-s,\z).
      \]
      This is the functional equation of $\z(s)$ and in this case is just a reformulation of the previous functional equation. From it we find that the root number is $\e(\z) = 1$ and that $\z(s)$ is self-dual. We can now show that the order of $\z(s)$ is $1$. As there is only a simple pole at $s = 1$, multiply by $(s-1)$ to clear the polar divisor. As the integrals in the integral representation are absolutely bounded, computing the order amounts to estimating the gamma factor. Since the reciprocal of the gamma function is of order $1$, we have
      \[
        \frac{1}{\g(s,\z)} \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}},
      \]
      for any $\e > 0$. Thus the reciprocal of the gamma factor is also of order $1$. It follows that
      \[
        (s-1)\z(s) \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}}.
      \]
      This shows $(s-1)\z(s)$ is of order $1$, and thus $\z(s)$ is as well after removing the polar divisor. We now compute the residue of $\z(s)$ at $s = 1$:

      \begin{proposition}\label{prop:zeta_residue}
        \[
          \Res_{s = 1}\z(s) = 1.
        \]
      \end{proposition}
      \begin{proof}
        The only term in the integral representation of $\z(s)$ contributing to the pole is $-\frac{1}{\g(s,\z)}\frac{1}{s(1-s)}$. Observe
        \[
          \lim_{s \to 1}\frac{1}{\g(s,\z)} = \lim_{s \to 1}\frac{\pi^{\frac{s}{2}}}{\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)} = 1,
        \]
        because $\G\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}$. Therefore
        \[
          \Res_{s = 1}\z(s) = \Res_{s = 1}-\frac{1}{\g(s,\z)}\frac{1}{s(1-s)} = \Res_{s = 1}-\frac{1}{s(1-s)} = \lim_{s \to 1}-\frac{(s-1)}{s(1-s)} = 1.
        \]
      \end{proof}

      We summarize all of our work into the following theorem:

      \begin{theorem}
        $\z(s)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function. For $\Re(s) > 1$, it has a locally absolutely uniformly convergent degree $1$ Euler product given by
        \[
          \z(s) = \prod_{p}(1-p^{-s})^{-1}.
        \]
        Moreover, it admits meromorphic continuation to $\C$ via the integral representation
        \[
          \z(s) = \frac{\pi^{\frac{s}{2}}}{\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)}\left[-\frac{1}{s(1-s)}+\int_{1}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{1-s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}+\int_{1}^{\infty}\w(x)x^{\frac{s}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}\right],
        \]
        with functional equation
        \[
          \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\z(s) = \L(s,\z) = \L(1-s,\z),
        \]
        and there is a simple pole at $s = 1$ of residue $1$.
      \end{theorem}

      Lastly, we note that by virtue of the functional equation we can also compute $\z(0)$ as well. Indeed, since $\Res_{s = 1}\z(s) = 1$, we have
      \[
        \lim_{s \to 1}(s-1)\L(s,\z) = \Res_{s = 1}\z(s)\lim_{s \to 1}\pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right) = 1.
      \]
      In other words, $\L(s,\z)$ has a simple pole at $s = 1$ with residue $1$ too. Since the completed zeta function is completely symmetric as $s \to 1-s$, it has a simple pole at $s = 0$ with residue $1$. Hence
      \[
        1 = \lim_{s \to 1}(s-1)\L(1-s,\z) = \Res_{s = 1}\G\left(\frac{1-s}{2}\right)\lim_{s \to 1}\pi^{-\frac{1-s}{2}}\z(1-s) = -2\z(0),
      \]
      because $\Res_{s = 0}\G(s) = 1$. Therefore $\z(0) = -\frac{1}{2}$.
  \section{Dirichlet \texorpdfstring{$L$}{L}-functions}
    \subsection*{The Definition \& Euler Product of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,\chi)$}{L(s,\chi)}}
      To every Dirichlet character $\chi$ there is an associated $L$-function. Throughout we will let $m$ denote the modulus and $q$ the conductor of $\chi$ respectively. The \textbf{Dirichlet $L$-function}\index{Dirichlet $L$-function} $L(s,\chi)$ attached to the Dirichlet character $\chi$ is defined as an $L$-series:
      \[
        L(s,\chi) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{\chi(n)}{n^{s}}.
      \]
      Since $\chi(n) = 0$ if $(n,m) > 1$, the above sum can be restricted to all integers relatively prime to $m$. We will see that $L(s,\chi)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function if $\chi$ is primitive and of conductor $q > 1$. As $|\chi(n)| \ll 1$, $L(s,\chi)$ is locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1$. Because $\chi$ is completely multiplicative we also have the degree $1$ Euler product,
      \[
        L(s,\chi) = \prod_{p}(1-\chi(p)p^{-s})^{-1} = \prod_{p \nmid m}(1-\chi(p)p^{-s})^{-1},
      \]
      in this region as well. The last equality holds because if $p \mid m$ we have $\chi(p) = 0$. So for $p \mid m$, the local factor at $p$ is $L_{p}(s,\chi) = 1$ with local root $0$. For $p \nmid m$ the local factor at $p$ is $L_{p}(s,\chi) = (1-\chi(p)p^{-s})^{-1}$ with local root $\chi(p)$. Now if $\chi$ is induced by $\wtilde{\chi}$, then $\chi(p) = \wtilde{\chi}(p)$ if $p \nmid q$ and $\chi(p) = 0$ if $p \mid m$ so that
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:non-primitive_primitive_Dirichlet_L-series_relation}
        L(s,\chi) = \prod_{p \nmid m}(1-\wtilde{\chi}(p)p^{-s})^{-1} = \prod_{p}(1-\wtilde{\chi}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}\prod_{p \mid m}(1-\wtilde{\chi}(p)p^{-s}) = L(s,\wtilde{\chi})\prod_{p \mid m}(1-\wtilde{\chi}(p)p^{-s}).
      \end{equation}
      From this relation, any Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,\chi)$ will also posess any properties $L(s,\wtilde{\chi})$ does up to local factors at primes $p$ dividing $m$. Therefore we may assume $\chi$ is primitive. We may also assume $q > 1$ for otherwise $\chi$ is the trivial character and so $L(s,\chi) = \z(s)$.
    \subsection*{The Integral Representation of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,\chi)$}{L(s,\chi)}: Part I}
      The integral representation for $L(s,\chi)$ is deduced in a similar way as for $\z(s)$. However, it will depend on if $\chi$ is even or odd. To handle both cases simultaneously let $\mf{a} = 0,1$ according to whether $\chi$ is even or odd. In other words,
      \[
        \mf{a} = \frac{\chi(1)-\chi(-1)}{2}.
      \]
      We also have $\chi(-1) = (-1)^{\mf{a}}$. Note that $\mf{a}$ takes the same value for both $\chi$ and $\cchi$. Making the substitution $s \to s+\mf{a}$ in \cref{equ:gamma_integral_substitution} and multiplying by $\chi(n)$ yields
      \[
        \chi(n)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}\right) = \pi^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}} n^{s}\int_{0}^{\infty}\chi(n)n^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi n^{2}x}x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x},
      \]
      after moving the $n^{\mf{a}}$ on the inside of the integral. Dividing by $\pi^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}n^{s}$ and summing over $n \ge 1$, we see that for $\Re(s) > 1$,
      \begin{align*}
        \pi^{-\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}\right)L(s,\chi) &= \sum_{n \ge 1}\int_{0}^{\infty}\chi(n)n^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi n^{2}x}x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} \\
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\sum_{n \ge 1}\chi(n)n^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi n^{2}x}x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} && \text{DCT} \\
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\w_{\chi}(x)x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x},
      \end{align*}
      where we set
      \[
        \w_{\chi}(x) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\chi(n)n^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi n^{2}x}.
      \]
      Therefore we have an integral representation
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:integral_representation_Dirichlet_L-functions_1}
        L(s,\chi) = \frac{\pi^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}}{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}\right)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\w_{\chi}(x)x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x},
      \end{equation}
      and just like $\z(s)$ we need to find a functional equation for $\w_{\chi}(x)$ before we can proceed.
    \subsection*{Dirichlet's Theta Function \texorpdfstring{$\vt_{\chi}(s)$}{\vt_{\chi}(s)}}
      \textbf{Dirichlet's theta function}\index{Dirichlet's theta function} $\vt_{\chi}(s)$ attached to the character $\chi$, is defined for $\Re(s) > 0$ by
      \[
        \vt_{\chi}(s) = \sum_{n \in \Z}\chi(n)n^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi n^{2}s} = 2\sum_{n \ge 1}\chi(n)n^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi n^{2}s}.
      \]
      It is locally absolutely uniformly convergent in this region by the ratio test. Notice that the term corresponding to $n = 0$ vanishes because $\chi(0) = 0$, and $\chi(n)n^{\mf{a}} = \chi(-n)(-n)^{\mf{a}}$ so that the $n$ and $-n$ terms agree. Therefore the relationship between the twisted theta function and $\w_{\chi}(s)$ is
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:twisted_omega_theta_relationship_for_Dirichlet_L-functions}
        \w_{\chi}(s) = \frac{\vt_{\chi}(s)}{2}.
      \end{equation}

      \begin{remark}
        \cref{equ:twisted_omega_theta_relationship_for_Dirichlet_L-functions} is a slightly less complex relationship than \cref{equ:omega_theta_relationship_for_zeta}. This is because assuming $q > 1$ means $\chi(0) = 0$.
      \end{remark}

      The essential fact we will need is the \textbf{functional equation for Dirichlet's theta function}\index{functional equation for Dirichlet's theta function}:

      \begin{theorem}[Functional equation for Dirichlet's theta function]
        Let $\chi$ be a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $q > 1$. For $\Re(s) > 0$,
        \[
          \vt_{\chi}(s) = \frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}(qs)^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}\vt_{\cchi}\left(\frac{1}{q^{2}s}\right).
        \]
      \end{theorem}
      \begin{proof}
        By the identity theorem it suffices to prove this on a set containg a limit point. We will prove this on the right-half of the real line, so take $s$ real with $s > 0$. Since $\chi$ is $q$-periodic, we can write
        \[
          \vt_{\chi}(s) = \sum_{a \tmod{q}}\chi(a)\sum_{m \in \Z}(mq+a)^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi(mq+a)^{2}s}.
        \]
        Set $f(x) = (xq+a)^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi(xq+a)^{2}s}$. Then $f(x)$ is a Schwarz function. We compute its Fourier transform:
        \[
          \hat{f}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-2\pi itx}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(xq+a)^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi(xq+a)^{2}s}e^{-2\pi itx}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(xq+a)^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi((xq+a)^{2}s+2itx)}\,dx.
        \]
        By performing the change of variables $x \to \frac{x}{q\sqrt{s}}-\frac{a}{q}$, the last integral above becomes
        \[
          \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi\left(x^{2}+\frac{2itx}{q\sqrt{s}}\right)}\,dx.
        \]
        Complete the square in the exponent by observing
        \[
          -\pi\left(x^{2}+\frac{2itx}{q\sqrt{s}}\right) = -\pi\left(\left(x+\frac{it}{q\sqrt{s}}\right)^{2}+\frac{t^{2}}{q^{2}s}\right).
        \]
        Taking exponentials, this implies that the previous integral is equal to
        \[
          \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi\left(x+\frac{it}{q\sqrt{s}}\right)^{2}}\,dx.
        \]
        The change of variables $x \to x-\frac{it}{q\sqrt{s}}$ is permitted without affecting the line of integration by viewing the integral as a complex integral, noting that the integrand is entire as a complex function, and shifting the line of integration. This gives
        \[
          \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(x-\frac{it}{q\sqrt{s}}\right)^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi x^{2}}\,dx = \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(x+\frac{t}{iq\sqrt{s}}\right)^{\mf{a}}e^{-\pi x^{2}}\,dx.
        \]
        If $\mf{a} = 0$, we obtain
        \begin{equation}\label{transformation_law_for_twisted_Jacobi's_theta_function_1}
          \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi x^{2}}\,dx = \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}},
        \end{equation}
        where the equality holds because the integral is $1$ since it is the Gaussian integral (see \cref{append:Special_Integrals}). If $\mf{a} = 1$, then by direct computation
        \[
          \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xe^{-\pi x^{2}}\,dx = -\frac{1}{2\pi}e^{-\pi x^{2}}\bigg|_{-\infty}^{\infty} = 0,
        \]
        and thus
        \begin{equation}\label{transformation_law_for_twisted_Jacobi's_theta_function_2}
          \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\frac{t}{iq\sqrt{s}}\right)e^{-\pi x^{2}}\,dx = \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\left(\frac{t}{iq\sqrt{s}}\right)\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi x^{2}}\,dx = \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\left(\frac{t}{iq\sqrt{s}}\right),
        \end{equation}
        where the last equality follows because the last integral is the Gaussian integral again. Since $\left(\frac{t}{iq\sqrt{s}}\right)^{\mf{a}} = 1$ if $\mf{a} = 0$, we can compactly express the right-hand sides of \cref{transformation_law_for_twisted_Jacobi's_theta_function_1,transformation_law_for_twisted_Jacobi's_theta_function_2} in the form
        \[
          \frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\left(\frac{t}{iq\sqrt{s}}\right)^{\mf{a}}.
        \]
        The Poisson summation formula then implies
        \begin{align*}
          \vt_{\chi}(s) &= \sum_{a \tmod{q}}\chi(a)\sum_{t \in \Z}\frac{e^{\frac{2\pi iat}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}}{qs^{\frac{1+\mf{a}}{2}}}\left(\frac{t}{iq\sqrt{s}}\right)^{\mf{a}} \\
          &= \frac{1}{i^{\mf{a}}q^{1+\mf{a}}s^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}\sum_{a \tmod{q}}\chi(a)\sum_{t \in \Z}t^{\mf{a}}e^{\frac{2\pi i at}{q}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}} \\
          &= \frac{1}{i^{\mf{a}}q^{1+\mf{a}}s^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}\sum_{t \in \Z}t^{\mf{a}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}\sum_{a \tmod{q}}\chi(a)e^{\frac{2\pi i at}{q}} \\
          &= \frac{1}{i^{\mf{a}}q^{1+\mf{a}}s^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}\sum_{t \in \Z}t^{\mf{a}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}\tau(t,\chi) && \text{definition of $\tau(t,\chi)$},
        \end{align*}
        and this holds for all $\Re(s) > 0$ by the identity theorem. Since $\chi$ is primitive, $\tau(t,\chi) = \cchi(t)\tau(\chi)$ for all $t \in \Z$ by \cref{cor:gauss_sum_primitive_formula}. Therefore we have
        \[
          \frac{1}{i^{\mf{a}}q^{1+\mf{a}}s^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}\sum_{t \in \Z}t^{\mf{a}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}}\tau(t,\chi) = \frac{\tau(\chi)}{i^{\mf{a}}q^{1+\mf{a}}s^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}\sum_{t \in \Z}\cchi(t)t^{\mf{a}}e^{-\frac{\pi t^{2}}{q^{2}s}} = \frac{\tau(\chi)}{i^{\mf{a}}q^{1+\mf{a}}s^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}\vt_{\cchi}\left(\frac{1}{q^{2}s}\right).
        \]
        Recalling that $\e_{\chi} = \frac{\tau(\chi)}{\sqrt{q}}$, we conclude
        \[
          \vt_{\chi}(s) = \frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}(qs)^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}\vt_{\cchi}\left(\frac{1}{q^{2}s}\right).
        \]
      \end{proof}
      The most striking property about this functional equation is that it relates $\vt_{\chi}(s)$ and $\vt_{\cchi}(s)$. Regardless, we can now exploit it to analytically continue $L(s,\chi)$.
    \subsection*{The Integral Representation of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,\chi)$}{L(s,\chi)}: Part II}
      Returning to $L(s,\chi)$, split the integral in \cref{equ:integral_representation_Dirichlet_L-functions_1} into two pieces
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:symmetric_integral_Dirichlet_L-functions_split}
        \int_{0}^{\infty}\w_{\chi}(x)x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} = \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{q}}\w_{\chi}(x)x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}+\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\w_{\chi}(x)x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}.
      \end{equation}
      Since $\w_{\chi}(x)$ has exponential decay as $x \to \infty$, the second piece is locally absolutely uniformly bounded for $\Re(s) > 1$ by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. Hence it is an analytic function. We now rewrite the first piece in the same form and symmetrize the result as much as possible. Start by performing a change of variables $x \to \frac{1}{q^{2}x}$ to the first piece to obtain
      \[
        q^{-(s+\mf{a})}\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\w_{\chi}\left(\frac{1}{q^{2}x}\right)x^{-\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}.
      \]
      Now the functional equation for Dirichlet's theta function $\vt_{\chi}(x)$ and \cref{equ:twisted_omega_theta_relationship_for_Dirichlet_L-functions} together imply
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:piece_one_Dirichlet_1}
        \begin{aligned}
          \w_{\chi}\left(\frac{1}{q^{2}x}\right) &= \frac{\vt_{\chi}\left(\frac{1}{q^{2}x}\right)}{2} \\
          &= \frac{i^{\mf{a}}(qx)^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}{\e_{\cchi}}\frac{\vt_{\cchi}(x)}{2} \\
          &= \e_{\chi}(-i)^{\mf{a}}(qx)^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\frac{\vt_{\cchi}(x)}{2} && \text{\cref{prop:epsilon_factor_relationship} and $\chi(-1) = (-1)^{\mf{a}}$} \\
          &= \frac{\e_{\chi}(qx)^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}{i^{\mf{a}}}\frac{\vt_{\cchi}(x)}{2} \\
          &= \frac{\e_{\chi}(qx)^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}{i^{\mf{a}}}\w_{\cchi}(x).
        \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}
      \cref{equ:piece_one_Dirichlet_1} gives the first equality in the following chain:
      \begin{align*}
        q^{-(s+\mf{a})}\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\w_{\chi}\left(\frac{1}{q^{2}x}\right)x^{-\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} &= q^{-(s+\mf{a})}\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\e_{\chi}(qx)^{\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}}{i^{\mf{a}}}\w_{\cchi}(x)\right)x^{-\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x} \\
        &= \frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}}q^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\w_{\cchi}(x)x^{\frac{(1-s)+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}.
      \end{align*}
      Substituting this last expression back into \cref{equ:symmetric_integral_Dirichlet_L-functions_split} with \cref{equ:integral_representation_Dirichlet_L-functions_1} gives the integral representation
      \[
        L(s,\chi) = \frac{\pi^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}}{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}\right)}\left[\frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}}q^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\w_{\cchi}(x)x^{\frac{(1-s)+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}+\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\w_{\chi}(x)x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}\right].
      \]
      This integral representation will give analytic continuation. Indeed, we know everything outside the brackets is entire. The two integrals are locally absolutely uniformly bounded on $\C$ by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. This gives analytic continuation to all of $\C$. In particular, $L(s,\chi)$ has no poles.
    \subsection*{The Functional Equation \& Critical Strip of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,\chi)$}{L(s,\chi)}}
      An immediate consequence of applying the symmetry $s \to 1-s$ to the integral representation is the following functional equation:
      \[
        q^{\frac{s}{2}}\frac{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}\right)}{\pi^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}}L(s,\chi) = \frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}}q^{\frac{1-s}{2}}\frac{\G\left(\frac{(1-s)+\mf{a}}{2}\right)}{\pi^{\frac{(1-s)+\mf{a}}{2}}}L(1-s,\cchi).
      \]
      We identify the gamma factor as
      \[
        \g(s,\chi) = \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}\right),
      \]
      with $\k = \mf{a}$ the only local root at infinity. Clearly it satisfies the required bounds. The conductor is $q(\chi) = q$ and if $p$ is an unramified prime then the local root is $\chi(p) \neq 0$. The completed $L$-function is
      \[
        \L(s,\chi) = q^{\frac{s}{2}}\pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)L(s,\chi),
      \]
      with functional equation
      \[
        \L(s,\chi) = \frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}}\L(1-s,\cchi).
      \]
      From it we see that the root number is $\e(\chi) = \frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}}$ and that $L(s,\chi)$ has dual $L(s,\cchi)$. We now show that $L(s,\chi)$ is of order $1$. Since $L(s,\chi)$ has no poles, we do not need to clear any polar divisors. As the integrals in the integral representation are absolutely bounded, computing the order amounts to estimating the gamma factor. Since the reciprocal of the gamma function is of order $1$, we have
      \[
        \frac{1}{\g(s,\chi)} \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}},
      \]
      for any $\e > 0$. So the reciprocal of the gamma factor is also of order $1$. It follows that
      \[
        L(s,\chi) \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}}.
      \]
      So $L(s,\chi)$ is of order $1$. We summarize all of our work into the following theorem:

      \begin{theorem}
        For any primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ with conductor $q > 1$, $L(s,\chi)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function. For $\Re(s) > 1$, it has a locally absolutely uniformly convergent degree $1$ Euler product given by
        \[
          L(s,\chi) = \prod_{p}(1-\chi(p)p^{-s})^{-1} = \prod_{p \nmid q}(1-\chi(p)p^{-s})^{-1}.
        \]
        Moreover, it admits analytic continuation to $\C$ via the integral representation
        \[
          L(s,\chi) = \frac{\pi^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}}{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}\right)}\left[\frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}}q^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\w_{\cchi}(x)x^{\frac{(1-s)+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}+\int_{\frac{1}{q}}^{\infty}\w_{\chi}(x)x^{\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}}\,\frac{dx}{x}\right],
        \]
        and with functional equation
        \[
          q^{\frac{s}{2}}\pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}}{2}\right)L(s,\chi) = \L(s,\chi) = \frac{\e_{\chi}}{i^{\mf{a}}}\L(1-s,\cchi).
        \]
      \end{theorem}

      We would like to make one last comment. We have shown that the Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,\chi)$ attached to a primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ of conductor $q > 1$ is a Selberg class $L$-function. This also holds for $q = 1$ because in this case $L(s,\chi) = \z(s)$. By \cref{equ:non-primitive_primitive_Dirichlet_L-series_relation} it follows that for any Dirichlet character $\chi$ modulo $m$, the Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,\chi)$ posses the same properties up to local factors at the primes dividing $m$. In particular, it admits a degree $1$ Euler product, analytic continuation to $\C$, and a functional equation as $s \to 1-s$ (although of a more complicated form). Moreover, $L(s,\chi)$ has a pole if and only if $\chi$ is a principal character because then the primitive character $\wtilde{\chi}$ inducing $\chi$ is the trivial character and so $L(s,\wtilde{\chi}) = \z(s)$.
  \section{Hecke \texorpdfstring{$L$}{L}-functions}
    \subsection*{The Definition \& Euler Product of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f)$}{L(s,f)}}
      We will investigate the $L$-functions of primitive Hecke eigenforms. Let $f \in \mc{S}_{k}(N,\chi)$ be a primitive Hecke eigenform and denote its Fourier series by
      \[
        f(z) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)e^{2\pi inz}.
      \]
      The \textbf{Hecke $L$-function}\index{Hecke $L$-function} $L(s,f)$ of $f$ is defined as an $L$-series:
      \[
        L(s,f) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f}(n)}{n^{s}} = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{\l_{f}(n)}{n^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}},
      \]
      where $a_{f}(n) = \l_{f}(n)n^{-\frac{k-1}{2}}$ (here we are abusing notation for the Fourier coefficeints of holomorphic forms). We will see that $L(s,f)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function. By the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture, $a_{f}(n) \ll n^{\e}$. So $L(s,f)$ is locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1+\e$ and hence locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1$. The $L$-function will also have an Euler product. Indeed, the Hecke relations imply that the coefficients $a_{f}(n)$ are multiplicative and satisfy
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:primitive_Hecke_eigenform_recurrence_for_coefficients_of_modular_L-function}
        a_{f}(p^{n}) = \begin{cases} a_{f}(p^{n-1})a_{f}(p)-\chi(p)a_{f}(p^{n-2}) & \text{if $p \nmid N$}, \\ (a_{f}(p))^{n} & \text{if $p \mid N$}, \end{cases}
      \end{equation}
      for all primes $p$ and $n \ge 2$. Because $L(s,f)$ converges absolutely in the region $\Re(s) > 1$, multiplicativity of the Hecke eigenvalues implies
      \[
        L(s,f) = \prod_{p}\left(\sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})}{p^{ns}}\right),
      \]
      in this region. We now simplify the factor inside the product using this \cref{equ:primitive_Hecke_eigenform_recurrence_for_coefficients_of_modular_L-function}. On the one hand, if $p \nmid N$:
      \begin{align*}
        \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})}{p^{ns}} &= 1+\frac{a_{f}(p)}{p^{s}}+\sum_{n \ge 2}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})}{p^{ns}} \\
        &= 1+\frac{a_{f}(p)}{p^{s}}+\sum_{n \ge 2}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n-1})a_{f}(p)-\chi(p)a_{f}(p^{n-2})}{p^{ns}} \\
        &= 1+\frac{a_{f}(p)}{p^{s}}+\frac{a_{f}(p)}{p^{s}}\sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})}{p^{ns}}-\frac{\chi(p)}{p^{2s}}\sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})}{p^{ns}} \\
        &= 1+\left(\frac{a_{f}(p)}{p^{s}}-\frac{\chi(p)}{p^{2s}}\right)\sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})}{p^{ns}}.
      \end{align*}
      By isolating the sum we find
      \[
        \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})}{p^{ns}} = \left(1-\frac{a_{f}(p)}{p^{s}}+\frac{\chi(p)}{p^{2s}}\right)^{-1}.
      \]
      On the other hand, if $p \mid N$ we have
      \[
        \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})}{p^{ns}} = \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{(a_{f}(p))^{n}}{p^{ns}} = \left(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}\right)^{-1}.
      \]
      Therefore
      \[
        L(s,f) = \prod_{p \nmid N}(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}+\chi(p)p^{-2s})^{-1}\prod_{p \mid N}(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}.
      \]
      If $p \nmid N$, let $\a_{1}(p)$ and $\a_{2}(p)$ be the roots of $1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}+\chi(p)p^{-2s}$. That is,
      \[
        (1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s})(1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s}) = (1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}+\chi(p)p^{-2s}).
      \]
      If $p \mid N$, let $\a_{1}(p) = a_{f}(p)$ and $\a_{2}(p) = 0$. We can then express $L(s,f)$ as a degree $2$ Euler product:
      \[
        L(s,f) = \prod_{p}(1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}(1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}.
      \]
      The local factor at $p$ is $L_{p}(s,f) = (1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}(1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}$ with local roots $\a_{1}(p)$ and $\a_{2}(p)$. Upon applying partial fraction decomposition to the local factor, we find
      \[
        \frac{1}{1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s}}\frac{1}{1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s}} = \frac{\frac{\a_{1}(p)}{\a_{1}(p)-\a_{2}(p)}}{1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s}}+\frac{\frac{-\a_{2}(p)}{\a_{1}(p)-\a_{2}(p)}}{1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s}}.
      \]
      Expanding both sides as series in $p^{-s}$, and comparing coefficients gives
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:Hecke_L_function_coefficient_formula}
        a_{f}(p^{n}) = \frac{\a_{1}(p)^{n+1}-\a_{2}(p)^{n+1}}{\a_{1}(p)-\a_{2}(p)}.
      \end{equation}
    \subsection*{The Integral Representation of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f)$}{L(s,f)}}
      We now want to find an integral representation for $L(s,f)$. Consider the following Mellin transform:
      \[
        \int_{0}^{\infty}f(iy)y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \]
      We don't yet know that this integral defines an analytic function for $\Re(s) > 1$. In any case, we compute
      \begin{align*}
        \int_{0}^{\infty}f(iy)y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)e^{-2\pi ny}y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} \\
        &= \sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-2\pi ny}y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} &&\text{DCT} \\
        &= \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{\l_{f}(n)}{(2\pi n)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-y}y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} &&\text{$y \to \frac{y}{2\pi n}$} \\
        &= \frac{\G\left(s+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}{(2\pi)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}}\sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{\l_{f}(n)}{n^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}} \\
        &= \frac{\G\left(s+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}{(2\pi)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}}L(s,f).
      \end{align*}
      As this last expression is analytic function for $\Re(s) > 1$, the integral is too. Rewriting, we have an integral representation
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:integral_representation_holomorphic_1}
        L(s,f) = \frac{(2\pi)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}}{\G\left(s+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}\int_{0}^{\infty}f(iy)y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \end{equation}
      Now split the integral on the right-hand side into two pieces
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:symmetric_integral_holomorphic_split}
        \int_{0}^{\infty}f(iy)y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} = \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}f(iy)y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}+\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}f(iy)y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \end{equation}
      Since $f(iy)$ has exponential decay as $y \to \infty$, the second piece is locally absolutely uniformly bounded for $\Re(s) > 1$ by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. Hence it is an analytic there. Now we will rewrite the first piece in the same form and symmetrize the result as much as possible. Begin by performing the change of variables $y \to \frac{1}{Ny}$ to the first piece to obtain
      \[
        \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}f\left(\frac{i}{Ny}\right)(Ny)^{-s-\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \]
      Rewriting in terms of the Atkin–Lehner involution and recalling that $\w_{N}f = \w_{N}(f)\conj{f}$ by \cref{prop:Atkin_Lehner_conjugation_holomorphic}, we have
      \begin{align*}
        \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}f\left(\frac{i}{Ny}\right)(Ny)^{-s-\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} &= \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}f\left(-\frac{1}{iNy}\right)(Ny)^{-s-\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} \\
        &= \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\sqrt{N}iy\right)^{k}(\w_{N}f)(iy)(Ny)^{-s-\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} \\
        &= \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\sqrt{N}iy\right)^{k}\w_{N}(f)\conj{f}(iy)(Ny)^{-s-\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y} \\
        &= \w_{N}(f)i^{k}N^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\conj{f}(iy)y^{(1-s)-\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \end{align*}
      Substituting this result back into \cref{equ:symmetric_integral_holomorphic_split} with \cref{equ:integral_representation_holomorphic_1} yields the integral representation
      \[
        L(s,f) = \frac{(2\pi)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}}{\G\left(s+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}\left[\w_{N}(f)i^{k}N^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\conj{f}(iy)y^{(1-s)+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}+\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}f(iy)y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}\right].
      \]
      This integral representation will give analytic continuation. To see this, we know everything outside the brackets is entire. The two integrals are locally absolutely uniformly bounded on $\C$ by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. Hence we have analytic continuation to all of $\C$. In particular, we have shown that $L(s,f)$ has no poles.
    \subsection*{The Functional Equation \& Critical Strip of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f)$}{L(s,f)}}
      An immediate consequence of applying the symmetry $s \to 1-s$ to the integral representation is the following functional equation:
      \[
        \frac{\G\left(s+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}{(2\pi)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}}L(s,f) = \w_{N}(f)i^{k}N^{-\frac{s}{2}}\frac{\G\left((1-s)+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}{(2\pi)^{(1-s)+\frac{k-1}{2}}}L(1-s,\conj{f}).
      \]
      Using the Legendre duplication formula for the gamma function we find that
      \begin{align*}
        \frac{\G\left(s+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}{(2\pi)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}} &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}2^{1-\left(s+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}\sqrt{\pi}}\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k+1}{2}}{2}\right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{2\pi^{s+\frac{1}{2}}}\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k+1}{2}}{2}\right) \\ 
        &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}}\pi^{-s}\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k+1}{2}}{2}\right).
      \end{align*}
      The constant factor in front is independent of $s$ and so can be canceled in the functional equation. Therefore we identify the gamma factor as
      \[
        \g(s,f) = \pi^{-s}\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k+1}{2}}{2}\right),
      \]
      with $\k_{1} = k-1$ and $\k_{2} = k+1$ the local roots at infinity. The conductor is $q(f) = N$, so the primes dividing the level ramify, and by the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture, $\a_{i}(p) \neq 0$ for $i = 1,2$ and all primes $p \nmid N$. The completed $L$-function is
      \[
        \L(s,f) = N^{-\frac{s}{2}}\pi^{-s}\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k+1}{2}}{2}\right)L(s,f),
      \]
      with functional equation
      \[
        \L(s,f) = \w_{N}(f)i^{k}\L(1-s,\conj{f}).
      \]
      This is the functional equation of $L(s,f)$. From it, the root number is $\e(f) = \w_{N}(f)i^{k}$ and we see that $L(s,f)$ has dual $L(s,\conj{f})$. We will now show that $L(s,f)$ is of order $1$. Since $L(s,f)$ has no poles, we do not need to clear any polar divisors. As the integrals in the representation is absolutely bounded, computing the order amounts to estimating the gamma factor. Since the reciprocal of the gamma function is of order $1$, we have
      \[
        \frac{1}{\g(s,f)} \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}},
      \]
      for any $\e > 0$. So the reciprocal of the gamma factor is also of order $1$. Then
      \[
        L(s,f) \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}}.
      \]
      So $L(s,f)$ is of order $1$. We summarize all of our work into the following theorem:

      \begin{theorem}
        For any primitive Hecke eigenform $f \in \mc{S}_{k}(N,\chi)$, $L(s,f)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function. For $\Re(s) > 1$, it has a locally absolutely uniformly convergent degree $2$ Euler product given by 
        \[
          L(s,f) = \prod_{p \nmid N}(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}+\chi(p)p^{-2s})^{-1}\prod_{p \mid N}(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s})^{-1} = \prod_{p}(1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}(1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}.
        \]
        Moreover, it admits analytic continuation to $\C$ via the integral representation
        \[
          L(s,f) = \frac{(2\pi)^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}}{\G\left(s+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}\left[\w_{N}(f)i^{k}N^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\conj{f}(iy)y^{(1-s)+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}+\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}f(iy)y^{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}\,\frac{dy}{y}\right],
        \]
        and with functional equation
        \[
          N^{-\frac{s}{2}}\pi^{-s}\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k-1}{2}}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\frac{k+1}{2}}{2}\right)L(s,f) = \L(s,f) = \w_{N}(f)i^{k}\L(1-s,\conj{f}).
        \]
      \end{theorem}
  \section{Hecke-Maass \texorpdfstring{$L$}{L}-functions}
    \subsection*{The Definition \& Euler Product of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f)$}{L(s,f)}}
      We will investigate the $L$-functions of primitive Hecke-Maass eigenforms. Much of the theory is identical to that of Hecke $L$-functions. Let $f \in \mc{C}_{t}(N,\chi)$ be a primitive Hecke-Maass eigenform and denote its Fourier series by
      \[
        f(z) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)\sqrt{y}K_{it}(2\pi ny)\SC(2\pi nx).
      \]
      The \textbf{Hecke-Maass $L$-function}\index{Hecke-Maass $L$-function} $L(s,f)$ of $f$ is defined as an $L$-series:
      \[
        L(s,f) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f}(n)}{n^{s}} = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{\l_{f}(n)}{n^{s}},
      \]
      where $a_{f}(n) = \l_{f}(n)$ (here we are abusing notation for the Fourier coefficeints of Maass forms). In this case, the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture is not know so $L(s,f)$ has not been proven to be a Selberg class $L$-function. Although, it is conjectured to be so throughout we will assume the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture. By the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture, $a_{f}(n) \ll n^{\e}$. So $L(s,f)$ is locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1+\e$ and hence locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1$. The $L$-function will have an Euler product. Indeed, the Hecke relations imply that the coefficients $a_{f}(n)$ are multiplicative and satisfy \cref{equ:primitive_Hecke_eigenform_recurrence_for_coefficients_of_modular_L-function}. Mimicing the argument exactly as for Hecke $L$-functions, 
      \[
        L(s,f) = \prod_{p \nmid N}(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}+\chi(p)p^{-2s})^{-1}\prod_{p \mid N}(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}.
      \]
      If $p \nmid N$, let $\a_{1}(p)$ and $\a_{2}(p)$ be the roots of $1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}+\chi(p)p^{-2s}$. That is,
      \[
        (1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s})(1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s}) = (1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}+\chi(p)p^{-2s}).
      \]
      If $p \mid N$, let $\a_{1}(p) = a_{f}(p)$ and $\a_{2}(p) = 0$. We can then express $L(s,f)$ as a degree $2$ Euler product:
      \[
        L(s,f) = \prod_{p}(1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}(1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}.
      \]
      The local factor at $p$ is $L_{p}(s,f) = (1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}(1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}$ with local roots $\a_{1}(p)$ and $\a_{2}(p)$. Moreover, just as in the case for Hecke $L$-functions, the formula \cref{equ:Hecke_L_function_coefficient_formula} also holds.
    \subsection*{The Integral Representation of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f)$}{L(s,f)}}
      We want to find an integral representation for $L(s,f)$. Recall that $f$ is an eigenfunction for $T_{-1}$ with eigenvalue $\pm 1$. Equivalently, $f$ is even if the eigenvalue is $1$ and odd if the eigenvalue is $-1$. The integral representation will depend upon this parity. To handle both cases simultaneously, let $\mf{a} = 0,1$ according to whether $f$ is even or odd. In other words,
      \[
        \mf{a} = \frac{1-\l_{f}(-1)}{2}.
      \]
      Now consider the following Mellin transform:
      \[
        \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(iy)y^{s-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \]
      The derivative operator is present because if $f$ is odd, $\SC(x) = \sin(x)$. In any case, the smoothness of $f$ implies that we may differentiate its Fourier series termwise to obtain
      \[
        \left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(z) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)(2\pi n)^{\mf{a}}\sqrt{y}K_{it}(2\pi ny)\cos(2\pi nx).
      \]
      Therefore regardless if $f$ is even or odd, the Fourier series of $\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(z)$ has $\SC(x) = \cos(x)$ and the integral does not vanish identically. Similar to Hecke $L$-functions, we don't yet know that this integral defines an analytic function for $\Re(s) > 1$. Nevertheless, we compute
      \begin{align*}
        \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(iy)y^{s-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)(2\pi n)^{\mf{a}}K_{it}(2\pi ny)y^{s+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} \\
        &= \sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)(2\pi n)^{\mf{a}}\int_{0}^{\infty}K_{it}(2\pi ny)y^{s+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} &&\text{DCT} \\
        &= \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{\l_{f}(n)}{(2\pi n)^{s}}\int_{0}^{\infty}K_{it}(y)y^{s+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} &&\text{$y \to \frac{y}{2\pi n}$} \\
        &= \frac{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)}{2^{2-\mf{a}}\pi^{s}}\sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{\l_{f}(n)}{n^{s}} && \text{\cref{append:Special_Integrals}} \\
        &= \frac{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)}{2^{2-\mf{a}}\pi^{s}}L(s,f).
      \end{align*}
      This last expression is analytic function for $\Re(s) > 1$ and so the integral is too. Rewriting, we have an integral representation
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:integral_representation_Maass_1}
        L(s,f) = \frac{2^{2-\mf{a}}\pi^{s}}{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(iy)y^{s-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \end{equation}
      Now split the integral on the right-hand side into two pieces
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:symmetric_integral_Maass_split}
        \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(iy)y^{s-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} = \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(iy)y^{s-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y}+\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(iy)y^{s-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \end{equation}
      Since $\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(iy)$ has polynomial decay as $y \to \infty$ because $f(iy)$ does, the second piece is locally absolutely uniformly bounded for $\Re(s) > 1$ by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. Hence it is analytic there. Now we will rewrite the first piece in the same form and symmetrize the result as much as possible. Performing the change of variables $y \to \frac{1}{Ny}$ to the first piece to obtain
      \[
        \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)\left(\frac{i}{Ny}\right)(Ny)^{-s+\frac{1}{2}-\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \]
      We wil rewrite this in terms of the Atkin–Lehner involution. But first we require an identity that relates $\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}$ with the Atkin-Lehner involution $\w_{N}$. By the identity theorem it suffices to verify this on a set containing a limit point. So let $z \in \H$ be such that $|z|$ is fixed. Observe that $-\frac{1}{Nz} = \frac{-x}{N|z|^{2}}+\frac{iy}{N|z|^{2}}$. Now differentiate termwise to see that
      \begin{align*}
        \left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}\w_{N}f\right)(z) &= \left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}\right)f\left(-\frac{1}{Nz}\right) \\
         &= \left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}\right)\sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)\sqrt{\frac{y}{N|z|^{2}}}K_{it}(2\pi ny)\SC\left(-2\pi n\frac{x}{N|z|^{2}}\right) \\
        &= (-N|z|^{2})^{-\mf{a}}\sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)(2\pi n)^{\mf{a}}\sqrt{\frac{y}{N|z|^{2}}}K_{it}\left(2\pi n\frac{y}{N|z|^{2}}\right)\cos\left(-2\pi n\frac{x}{N|z|^{2}}\right) \\
        &= (-N|z|^{2})^{-\mf{a}}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)\left(-\frac{1}{Nz}\right).
      \end{align*}
      So by the identity theorem,
      \[
        \left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)\left(-\frac{1}{Nz}\right) = (-N|z|^{2})^{\mf{a}}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}\w_{N}f\right)(z),
      \]
      holds for all $z \in \H$. Rewriting in terms of the Atkin–Lehner involution and recalling that $\w_{N}f = \w_{N}(f)\conj{f}$ by \cref{prop:Atkin_Lehner_conjugation_Maass}, we find that
      \begin{align*}
        \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)\left(\frac{i}{Ny}\right)(Ny)^{-s+\frac{1}{2}-\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} &= \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)\left(-\frac{1}{iNy}\right)(Ny)^{-s+\frac{1}{2}-\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} \\
        &= \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}(-Ny^{2})^{\mf{a}}\left(\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}\right)\w_{N}f\right)(iy)(Ny)^{-s+\frac{1}{2}-\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} \\
        &= \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}(-Ny^{2})^{\mf{a}}\w_{N}(f)\left(\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}\right)\conj{f}\right)(iy)(Ny)^{-s+\frac{1}{2}-\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y} \\
        &= w_{N}(f)(-1)^{\mf{a}}N^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}\right)\conj{f}\right)(iy)y^{(1-s)-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y}.
      \end{align*}
      Substituting this result back into \cref{equ:symmetric_integral_Maass_split} with \cref{equ:integral_representation_Maass_1} gives the integral representation
      \begin{align*}
        L(s,f) &= \frac{2^{2-\mf{a}}\pi^{s}}{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)} \\
        &\cdot \left[w_{N}(f)(-1)^{\mf{a}}N^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}\right)\conj{f}\right)(iy)y^{(1-s)-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y}+\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\del}{\del x}^{\mf{a}}f\right)(iy)y^{s-\frac{1}{2}+\mf{a}}\,\frac{dy}{y}\right].
      \end{align*}
      This integral representation will give analytic continuation. Indeed, everything outside the brackets is entire and the two integrals are locally absolutely uniformly bounded on $\C$ by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. Hence we have analytic continuation to all of $\C$. In particular, $L(s,f)$ has no poles.
    \subsection*{The Functional Equation \& Critical Strip of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f)$}{L(s,f)}}
      An immediate consequence of applying the symmetry $s \to 1-s$ to the integral representation is the following functional equation:
      \[
        \frac{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)}{2^{2-\mf{a}}\pi^{s}}L(s,f) = \w_{N}(f)(-1)^{\mf{a}}N^{-\frac{s}{2}}\frac{\G\left(\frac{(1-s)+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{(1-s)+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)}{2^{2-\mf{a}}\pi^{1-s}}L(1-s,\conj{f}).
      \]
      The constant factor in the denominator is independent of $s$ and so can be canceled in the functional equation. Therefore we identify the gamma factor as
      \[
        \g(s,f) = \pi^{-s}\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right),
      \]
      with $\k_{1} = \mf{a}+it$ and $\k_{2} = \mf{a}-it$ the local roots at infinity. The conductor is $q(f) = N$, so the primes dividing the level ramify, and by the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture, $\a_{i}(p) \neq 0$ for $i = 1,2$ and all primes $p \nmid N$. The completed $L$-function is
      \[
        \L(s,f) = N^{-\frac{s}{2}}\pi^{-s}\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)L(s,f),
      \]
      with functional equation
      \[
        \L(s,f) = \w_{N}(f)(-1)^{\mf{a}}\L(1-s,\conj{f}).
      \]
      This is the functional equation of $L(s,f)$. From it, the root number is $\e(f) = \w_{N}(f)(-1)^{\mf{a}}$ and we see that $L(s,f)$ has dual $L(s,\conj{f})$. We will now show that $L(s,f)$ is of order $1$. Since $L(s,f)$ has no poles, we do not need to clear any polar divisors. As the integrals in the representation is absolutely bounded, computing the order amounts to estimating the gamma factor. Since the reciprocal of the gamma function is of order $1$, we have
      \[
        \frac{1}{\g(s,f)} \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}},
      \]
      for any $\e > 0$. So the reciprocal of the gamma factor is also of order $1$. Then
      \[
        L(s,f) \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}}.
      \]
      So $L(s,f)$ is of order $1$. We summarize all of our work into the following theorem:

      \begin{theorem}
        For any primitive Hecke-Maass eigenform $f \in \mc{C}_{t}(N,\chi)$, $L(s,f)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function provided the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture holds. For $\Re(s) > 1$, it has a locally absolutely uniformly convergent degree $2$ Euler product given by 
        \[
          L(s,f) = \prod_{p \nmid N}(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s}+\chi(p)p^{-2s})^{-1}\prod_{p \mid N}(1-a_{f}(p)p^{-s})^{-1} = \prod_{p}(1-\a_{1}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}(1-\a_{2}(p)p^{-s})^{-1}.
        \]
        Moreover, it admits analytic continuation to $\C$ via the integral representation
        \begin{align*}
          L(s,f) &= \frac{2^{2-\mf{a}}\pi^{s}}{\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)} \\

        \end{align*}
        and with functional equation
        \[
          N^{-\frac{s}{2}}\pi^{-s}\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}+it}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+\mf{a}-it}{2}\right)L(s,f) = \L(s,f) = \w_{N}(f)(-1)^{\mf{a}}\L(1-s,\conj{f}).

  \section{The Rankin-Selberg Method}
    \subsection*{The Definition \& Euler Product of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f \ox g)$}{L(s,f \ox g)}}
      The Rankin-Selberg method is a process by which we can construct new $L$-functions from old ones. We discuss the method only in the simplest case since many technical difficulties arise in the fully general setting. Let $f,g \in \mc{S}_{k}(\PSL_{2}(\Z))$ be primitive Hecke eigenforms with Fourier series
      \[
        f(z) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{f}(n)e^{2\pi inz} \quad \text{and} \quad g(z) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\l_{g}(n)e^{2\pi inz}.
      \]
      The $L$-function $L(s,f \x g)$ of $f$ and $g$ is give by the $L$-series
      \[
        L(s,f \x g) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f \x g}(n)}{n^{s}} = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f}(n)\conj{b_{g}(n)}}{n^{s}} = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{\l_{f}(n)\conj{\l_{g}(n)}}{n^{s+k-1}},
      \]
      The \textbf{Rankin-Selberg convolution}\index{Rankin-Selberg convolution} $L(s,f \ox g)$ of $f$ and $g$ is defined as an $L$-series:
      \[
        L(s,f \ox g) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f \ox g}(n)}{n^{s}} = \z(2s)L(s,f \x g),
      \]
      where $a_{f \ox g}(n) = \sum_{n = m\ell^{2}}a_{f}(m)\conj{b_{g}(m)}$. Since $a_{f}(n) \ll n^{\e}$ and $b_{g}(n) \ll n^{\e}$ by the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture, $a_{f \x g}(n) \ll n^{\e}$ as well. Hence $L(s,f \x g)$ is locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1+\e$ and hence locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1$. Since $\z(2s)$ is also locally absolutely uniformly convergent in this region, the same follows for $L(s,f \x g)$ too. The $L$-function $L(s,f \x g)$ will also have an Euler product. To see this, let $\a_{i}(p)$ and $\b_{j}(p)$ for $1 \le i,j \le 2$ be the local roots at $p$ of $L(s,f)$ and $L(s,g)$ respectively. Since $L(s,f \ox g)$ converges absolutely in the region $\Re(s) > 1$, for $s$ in this region, multiplicativity of the Hecke eigenvalues implies
      \[
        L(s,f \ox g) = \z(2s)L(s,f \x g) = \prod_{p \nmid NM}(1-p^{-2s})^{-1}\prod_{p}\left(\sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})\conj{b_{g}(p^{n})}}{p^{ns}}\right).
      \]
      We now simplify the factor inside the latter product using \cref{equ:Hecke_L_function_coefficient_formula}:

          \begin{align*}
            \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})\conj{b_{g}(p^{n})}}{p^{ns}} &= \sum_{n \ge 0}\left(\frac{\a_{1}(p)^{n+1}-\a_{2}(p)^{n+1}}{\a_{1}(p)-\a_{2}(p)}\right)\left(\frac{(\conj{\b_{1}(p)})^{n+1}-(\conj{\b_{2}(p)})^{n+1}}{\conj{\b_{1}(p)}-\conj{\b_{2}(p)}}\right)p^{-ns} \\

            &+\a_{2}(p)\conj{\b_{2}(p)}\left(1-\a_{2}(p)\conj{\b_{2}(p)}p^{-s}\right)^{-1}-\a_{1}(p)\conj{\b_{2}(p)}\left(1-\a_{1}(p)\conj{\b_{2}(p)}p^{-s}\right)^{-1} \\

          \end{align*}
      \endgroup
      The term in the brackets simplifies to
      \[
        \left(1-\a_{1}(p)\a_{2}(p)\conj{\b_{1}(p)}\conj{\b_{2}(p)}p^{-2s}\right)(\a_{1}(p)-\a_{2}(p))\left(\conj{\b_{1}(p)}-\conj{\b_{2}(p)}\right),
      \]
      because all of the other terms are killed by symmetry in $\a_{1}(p)$, $\a_{2}(p)$, $\conj{\b_{1}(p)}$, and $\conj{\b_{2}(p)}$. The Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture implies $\a_{1}(p)\a_{2}(p)\conj{\b_{1}(p)}\conj{\b_{2}(p)} = 1$. Therefore the corresponding factor above is $(1-p^{-2s})$. This factor cancels the local factor at $p$ in the Euler product of $\z(2s)$, so that
      \[
        \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{a_{f}(p^{n})\conj{b_{g}(p^{n})}}{p^{ns}} = \prod_{1 \le i,j \le 2}\left(1-\a_{i}(p)\conj{\b_{j}(p)}p^{-s}\right)^{-1}.
      \]
      So in total we have a degree $4$ Euler product,
      \[
        L(s,f \ox g) = \prod_{p}\prod_{1 \le i,j \le 2}\left(1-\a_{i}(p)\conj{\b_{j}(p)}p^{-s}\right)^{-1}.
      \]
      The local factor at $p$ is $L_{p}(s,f \ox g) = \prod_{1 \le i,j \le 2}\left(1-\a_{i}(p)\conj{\b_{j}(p)}p^{-s}\right)^{-1}$.
    \subsection*{The Integral Representation of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f \ox g)$}{L(s,f \ox g)}: Part I}
      We now look for an integral representation for $L(s,f \ox g)$. Consider the following integral:
      \[
        \int_{\G_{\infty}\backslash\H}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{s+k}\,d\mu,
      \]
      This will turn out to be a Mellin transform as we will soon see. The region of convergence of this integral is not immediately clear because we cannot appeal to \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral} directly. Indeed,
      \[
        \G_{\infty}\backslash\H = \{z \in \H:0 \le \Re(z) \le 1 \},
      \]
      intersects infinitely many fundamental domains for $\G$. In any case, we have
      \begin{align*}
        \int_{\G_{\infty}\backslash\H}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{s+k}\,d\mu &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{1}f(x+iy)\conj{g(x+iy)}y^{s+k}\,\frac{dx\,dy}{y^{2}} \\
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{1}\sum_{n,m \ge 1}a(n)\conj{b(m)}e^{2\pi i(n-m)x}e^{-2\pi(n+m)y}y^{s+k}\,\frac{dx\,dy}{y^{2}} \\
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\sum_{n,m \ge 1}\int_{0}^{1}a(n)\conj{b(m)}e^{2\pi i(n-m)x}e^{-2\pi(n+m)y}y^{s+k}\,\frac{dx\,dy}{y^{2}} && \text{DCT} \\
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\sum_{n \ge 1}a(n)\conj{b(n)}e^{-4\pi ny}y^{s+k}\,\frac{dy}{y^{2}},
      \end{align*}
      where the last line follows by \cref{equ:Dirac_integral_representation}. Notice that the last integral is a Mellin transform. The rest is a computation:
      \begin{align*}
        \int_{0}^{\infty}\sum_{n \ge 1}a(n)\conj{b(n)}e^{-4\pi ny}y^{s+k}\,\frac{dy}{y^{2}} &= \sum_{n \ge 1}a(n)\conj{b(n)}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-4\pi ny}y^{s+k}\,\frac{dy}{y^{2}} &&\text{DCT} \\
        &= \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a(n)\conj{b(n)}}{(4\pi n)^{s+k-1}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-y}y^{s+k-1}\,\frac{dy}{y} &&\text{$y \to \frac{y}{4\pi n}$} \\
        &= \frac{\G\left(s+k-1\right)}{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}}\sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a(n)\conj{b(n)}}{n^{s+k-1}} \\
        &= \frac{\G\left(s+k-1\right)}{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}}L(s,f \x g).
      \end{align*}
      This last expression is locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1$ because the $L$-function is and the gamma factor is holomorphic in this region. Therefore the original integral is locally absolutely uniformly bounded. At this point we have an integral representation
      \[
        L(s,f \x g) = \frac{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}}{\G(s+k-1)}\int_{\G_{\infty}\backslash\H}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{s+k}\,d\mu.
      \]
      We rewrite the integral as follows:
      \begin{align*}
        \int_{\G_{\infty}\backslash\H}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{s+k}\,d\mu &= \int_{\mc{F}}\sum_{\g \in \GG}f(\g z)\conj{g(\g z)}\Im(\g z)^{s+k}\,d\mu && \text{folding} \\
        &= \int_{\mc{F}}\sum_{\g \in \GG}j(\g,z)^{k}\conj{j(\g,z)^{k}}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(\g z)^{s+k}\,d\mu && \text{modularity} \\
        &= \int_{\mc{F}}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\sum_{\g \in \GG}|j(\g,z)|^{2k}\Im(\g z)^{s+k}\,d\mu \\
        &= \int_{\mc{F}}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{k}\sum_{\g \in \GG}\Im(\g z)^{s}\,d\mu \\
        &= \int_{\mc{F}}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{k}E_{\infty}(z,s)\,d\mu.
      \end{align*}
      Note that $E_{\infty}(z,s)$ is the Eisenstein series on $\PSL_{2}(\Z)\backslash\H$ at the $\infty$ cusp. Altogether, this gives the integral representation
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:Rankin-Selberg_integral-reresentation}
        L(s,f \x g) =  \frac{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}}{\G(s+k-1)}\int_{\mc{F}}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{k}E_{\infty}(z,s)\,d\mu,
      \end{equation}
      which is valid for $\Re(s) > 1$. We cannot investigate the integral any further until we understand the Fourier series of $E_{\infty}(z,s)$ and have a functional equation as $s \to 1-s$. Therefore we will take a necessary detour and return to the integral after.
    \subsection*{The Fourier Series and Functional Equation of \texorpdfstring{$E_{\infty}(z,s)$}{E_{\infty}(z,s)}}
      Let
      \[
        E_{\infty}(z,s) = \sum_{n \in \Z}a(n,y,s)e^{2\pi inx}.
      \]
      be the Fourier series of $E_{\infty}(z,s)$. Our first goal is to compute these coefficients. To do this we will need the following technical lemma:

      \begin{lemma}\label{lem:Ramanujan_zeta_relation}
        Let $M \ge 1$ be square-free. Then for $\Re(s) > 1$ and $b \in \Z$,
        \[
          \sum_{m \ge 1}\frac{r(b;m)}{m^{2s}} = \begin{cases} \frac{\z(2s-1)}{\z(2s)} & \text{if $b = 0$}, \\ \frac{\s_{1-2s}(|b|)}{\z(2s)} & \text{if $b \neq 0$}, \end{cases}
        \]
        where $\s_{s}(b)$ is the generalized sum of divisors function.
      \end{lemma}
      \begin{proof}
        If $\Re(s) > 1$ then the desired evaulation of the sum is locally absolutely uniformly convergent because the Riemann zeta function is in that region. Hence the sum will be too provided we prove the identity. Suppose $b = 0$. Then $r(0;m) = \phi(m)$. Since $\phi(m)$ is multiplicative we have
        \begin{equation}\label{equ:Ramanujan_zeta_relation_1}
          \sum_{m \ge 1}\frac{\phi(m)}{m^{2s}} = \prod_{p}\left(\sum_{k \ge 0}\frac{\phi(p^{k})}{p^{k(2s)}}\right).
        \end{equation}
        Recalling that $\phi(p^{k}) = p^{k}-p^{k-1}$ for $k \ge 1$, make the following computation:
        \begin{equation}\label{equ:Ramanujan_zeta_relation_2}
          \begin{aligned}
            \sum_{k \ge 0}\frac{\phi(p^{k})}{p^{k(2s)}} &= 1+\sum_{k \ge 1}\frac{p^{k}-p^{k-1}}{p^{k(2s)}} \\
            &= \sum_{k \ge 0}\frac{1}{p^{k(2s-1)}}-\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k \ge 1}\frac{1}{p^{k(2s-1)}} \\
            &= \sum_{k \ge 0}\frac{1}{p^{k(2s-1)}}-p^{-2s}\sum_{k \ge 0}\frac{1}{p^{k(2s-1)}} \\
            &= (1-p^{-2s})\sum_{k \ge 0}\frac{1}{p^{k(2s-1)}} \\
            &= \frac{1-p^{-2s}}{1-p^{-(2s-1)}}.
          \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        Combining \cref{equ:Ramanujan_zeta_relation_1,equ:Ramanujan_zeta_relation_2} gives
        \[
          \sum_{m \ge 1}\frac{\phi(m)}{m^{2s}} = \frac{\z(2s-1)}{\z(2s)}.
        \]
        Now suppose $b \neq 0$, \cref{prop:Ramanujan_sum_evaluation} gives the first equality in the following chain:
        \begin{align*}
          \sum_{m \ge 1}\frac{r(b;m)}{m^{2s}} &= \sum_{m \ge 1}m^{-2s}\sum_{\ell \mid (b,m)}\ell\mu\left(\frac{m}{\ell}\right) \\
          &= \sum_{\ell \mid b}\ell\sum_{m \ge 1}\frac{\mu(m)}{(m\ell)^{2s}} \\
          &= \left(\sum_{\ell \mid b}\ell^{1-2s}\right)\left(\sum_{m \ge 1}\frac{\mu(m)}{m^{2s}}\right) \\
          &= \s_{1-2s}(b)\sum_{m \ge 1}\frac{\mu(m)}{m^{2s}} \\
          &= \s_{1-2s}(|b|)\sum_{m \ge 1}\frac{\mu(m)}{m^{2s}} \\
          &= \frac{\s_{1-2s}(|b|)}{\z(2s)} && \text{\cref{prop:Dirichlet_Mobius_is_zeta_inverse}}.
        \end{align*}
      \end{proof}

      We can now compute the Fourier coefficients $a(n,y,s)$:

      \begin{proposition}\label{prop:Fourier_coefficients_of_real-analytic_Eisenstein_series}
        The Fourier coefficients $a(n,y,s)$ are given by
        \[
          a(n,y,s) = \begin{cases} y^{s}+y^{1-s}\frac{\sqrt{\pi}\G\left(s-\frac{1}{2}\right)\z(2s-1)}{\G(s)\z(2s)} & \text{if $n = 0$}, \\ 2\pi^{s}\frac{|n|^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\s_{1-2s}(|n|)}{\G(s)\z(2s)}\sqrt{y}K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y) & \text{if $n \neq 0$}. \end{cases}
        \]
      \end{proposition}
      \begin{proof}
        By \cref{rem:Bruhat_bijection}, we have
        \[
          E_{\infty}(z,s) = y^{s}+\sum_{\substack{c \ge 1, d \in \Z \\ (c,d) = 1}}\frac{y^{s}}{|cx+icy+d|^{2s}}.
        \]
        The definition of the Fourier coefficients gives
        \begin{equation}\label{equ:real-analytic_Eisenstein_fourier_coefficient_definition}
          a(n,y,s) = \int_{0}^{1}E(x+iy,s)e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx = y^{s}\d_{n,0}+\int_{0}^{1}\sum_{\substack{c \ge 1, d \in \Z \\ (c,d) = 1}}\frac{y^{s}}{|cx+icy+d|^{2s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx,
        \end{equation}
        where we have used \cref{equ:Dirac_integral_representation}. We are now reduced to computing
        \[
          I(z,s) = \int_{0}^{1}\sum_{\substack{c \ge 1, d \in \Z \\ (c,d) = 1}}\frac{y^{s}}{|cx+icy+d|^{2s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx.
        \]
        Make the following observation: summing over all pairs $(c,d)$ with $c \ge 1$, $d \in \Z$, $c \equiv 0 \tmod{NM}$, and $(c,d) = 1$ is the same as summing over all triples $(c,\ell,r)$ with $c \ge 1$, $\ell \in \Z$, $r \tmod{c}$, with $c \equiv 0 \tmod{NM}$ and $(r,c) = 1$. This is seen by writing $d = c\ell+r$. Therefore
        \begin{align*}
          I(z,s) &= \int_{0}^{1}\sum_{\substack{c \ge 1, d \in \Z \\ (c,d) = 1}}\frac{y^{s}}{|cx+icy+d|^{2s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx \\
          &= \int_{0}^{1}\sum_{(c,\ell,r)}\frac{y^{s}}{|c(x+\ell)+r+icy|^{2s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx \\
          &= \sum_{(c,\ell,r)}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{y^{s}}{|c(x+\ell)+r+icy|^{2s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx &&\text{DCT} \\
          &= \sum_{(c,\ell,r)}\frac{1}{c^{2s}}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{y^{s}}{\left|x+\ell+\frac{r}{c}+iy\right|^{2s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx \\
          &= \sum_{(c,\ell,r)}\frac{1}{c^{2s}}\int_{\ell}^{\ell+1}\frac{y^{s}}{\left|x+\frac{r}{c}+iy\right|^{2s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx &&\text{$x \to x-\ell$} \\
          &= \psum_{\substack{c \ge 1 \\ r \tmod{c}}}\frac{1}{c^{2s}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{y^{s}}{\left|x+\frac{r}{c}+iy\right|^{2s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx &&\text{DCT} \\
          &= \sum_{c \ge 1}\frac{1}{c^{2s}}\psum_{r \tmod{c}}e^{\frac{2\pi inr}{c}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{y^{s}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx &&\text{$x \to x-\frac{r}{c}$} \\
          &= \sum_{c \ge 1}\frac{r(n;c)}{c^{2s}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{y^{s}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{s}}e^{-2\pi inx}\,dx \\
          &= \sum_{c \ge 1}\frac{r(n;c)}{c^{2s}}y^{1-s}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x^{2}+1)^{s}}e^{-2\pi inxy}\,dx && \text{$x \to xy$},
        \end{align*}
        where on the right-hand side it is understood we are summing over all triples $(c,\ell,r)$ with the prescribed properties. Using \cref{lem:Ramanujan_zeta_relation} yields
        \[
          I(z,s) = \begin{cases} \frac{\z(2s-1)}{\z(2s)}y^{1-s}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x^{2}+1)^{s}}\,dx & \text{if $n = 0$}, \\ \frac{\s_{1-2s}(|n|)}{\z(2s)}y^{1-s}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x^{2}+1)^{s}}e^{-2\pi inxy}\,dx & \text{if $n \neq 0$}. \end{cases}
        \]
        Appealing to \cref{append:Special_Integrals} for this last integral and substiuting the result back into \cref{equ:real-analytic_Eisenstein_fourier_coefficient_definition} finishes the proof.
      \end{proof}

      Having computed the Fourier coefficients, we would like to obtain a functional equation for $E_{\infty}(z,s)$ as $s \to 1-s$ (this follows from \cref{thm:functional_equation_of_Eisenstein_series} but we will demonstrate a full proof for the single Eisenstein series on $\PSL_{2}(\Z)\backslash\H$). To this end, we define the \textbf{completed real-analytic Eisenstein series}\index{completed real-analytic Eisenstein series} $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ by
      \[
        E^{\ast}(z,s) = \L(2s,\z)E_{\infty}(z,s) = \pi^{-s}\G(s)\z(2s)E_{\infty}(z,s).
      \]
      From \cref{prop:Fourier_coefficients_of_real-analytic_Eisenstein_series}, the Fourier coefficients $a^{\ast}(n,y,s)$ of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ are given by
      \[
        a^{\ast}(n,y,s) = \begin{cases} y^{s}\pi^{-s}\G(s)\z(2s)+y^{1-s}\pi^{-\left(s-\frac{1}{2}\right)}\G(s-\frac{1}{2})\z(2s-1) & \text{if $n = 0$}, \\ 2|n|^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\s_{1-2s}(|n|)\sqrt{y}K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y) & \text{if $n \neq 0$}. \end{cases}
      \]
      We can derive a functional equation for $E^{\ast}(z,s)$. Using the definition and functional equation for $\L(2s-1,\z)$, we can rewrite the second term in the constant coefficient to get
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:Fourier_coefficients_for_completed_real-analytic_Eisenstein_series}
        a^{\ast}(n,y,s) = \begin{cases} y^{s}\L(2s,\z)+y^{1-s}\L(2(1-s),\z) & \text{if $n = 0$}, \\ 2|n|^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\s_{1-2s}(|n|)\sqrt{y}K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y) & \text{if $n \neq 0$}. \end{cases}
      \end{equation}
      Now observe that the constant coefficient is invariant under $s \to 1-s$. Each $n \neq 0$ coefficeint is also invariant under $s \to 1-s$. To see this we will use two facts. First, from \cref{append:Bessel_Functions}, $K_{s}(y)$ is invariant under $s \to -s$ and so $K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y)$ is invariant as $s \to 1-s$. Second, for $n \ge 1$ we have
      \[
        n^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\s_{1-2s}(n) = n^{\frac{1}{2}-s}n^{2s-1}\s_{1-2s}(n) = n^{\frac{1}{2}-s}n^{2s-1}\sum_{d \mid n}d^{1-2s} = n^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\sum_{d \mid n}\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)^{2s-1} = n^{\frac{1}{2}-s}\s_{2s-1}(n),
      \]
      where the second to last equality follows by writing $n^{2s-1} = \left(\frac{n}{d}\right)^{2s-1}d^{2s-1}$ for each $d \mid n$. These two facts together give the invariance of the $n \neq 0$ coefficients under $s \to 1-s$. Altogether, we have shown the following functional equation for $E^{\ast}(z,s)$:
      \[
        E^{\ast}(z,s) = E^{\ast}(z,1-s).
      \]
      We already knew $E_{\infty}(z,s)$ possessed a functional equation as $s \to 1-s$ from \cref{thm:functional_equation_of_Eisenstein_series} but we needed an explicit version in order to understand $L(s,f \ox g)$. We can now obtain meromorphic continuation of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ in $s$ to all of $\C$. By the functional equation, $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ admits analytic continious to $\C$ outside of the critical strip. Therefore we may assume $\left|\Re(s)-\frac{1}{2}\right| \le \frac{1}{2}$. We first write $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ as a Fourier series using \cref{equ:Fourier_coefficients_for_completed_real-analytic_Eisenstein_series}:
      \[
        E^{\ast}(z,s) = y^{s}\L(2s,\z)+y^{1-s}\L(2(1-s),\z)+\sum_{n \neq 0}2|n|^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\s_{1-2s}(|n|)\sqrt{y}K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y)e^{2\pi inx}.
      \]
      Since $\L(2s,\z)$ is meromorphic on the critial strip, the constant term of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ is as well. To finish the meromorphic continuation of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ it now suffices to show
      \[
        \sum_{n \neq 0}2|n|^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\s_{1-2s}(|n|)\sqrt{y}K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y)e^{2\pi inx},
      \]
      is meromorphic on the critial strip. We will actually prove it is locally absolutely uniformly convergent on this region. To achieve this we need two bounds, one for $\s_{1-2s}(|n|)$ and one for $K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y)$. For the first bound, we use the estimate $\s_{0}(n) \ll n^{\e}$. Therefore we have the crude bound
      \[
        \s_{1-2s}(|n|) = \sum_{d \mid n}d^{1-2s} < \s_{0}(|n|)|n|^{1-2s} \ll_{\e}|n|^{1-2s+\e}.
      \]
      For the second estimate, \cref{lem:exponential_decay_K-Bessel_function} and the fact that $\Re(s)$ is bounded together give
      \[
        K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y) \ll e^{-2\pi|n|y}.
      \]
      Using these two estimates, we have
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:non-constant_Fourier_coefficient_bound_non-holomorphic_Eisenstein_series}
        \sum_{n \neq 0}2|n|^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\s_{1-2s}(|n|)\sqrt{y}K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y)e^{2\pi inx} \ll_{\e} \sum_{n \ge 1}4n^{\frac{1}{2}-s+\e}\sqrt{y}e^{-2\pi ny}.
      \end{equation}
      This latter series is locally absolutely uniformly convergent by the ratio test. The meromorphic continuation of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ to $\C$ in $s$ follows. It remains to investigate the poles and residues. We will acomplish this from direct inspection of the Fourier coefficients:

      \begin{proposition}\label{equ:completed_real-analytic_Eisenstein_series_residues}
        $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ has simple poles at $s = 0$ and $s = 1$, and
        \[
          \Res_{s = 0}E^{\ast}(z,s) = -\frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \Res_{s = 1}E^{\ast}(z,s) = \frac{1}{2}.
        \]
      \end{proposition}
      \begin{proof}
        Since the constant term in the Fourier series of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ is the only non-holomorphic term, poles of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ can only come from that term. So we are reduced to understanding the poles of
        \begin{equation}\label{equ:constant_coefficient_of_completed_non-holomorphic_Eisenstein_series}
          y^{s}\L(2s,\z)+y^{1-s}\L(2(1-s),\z).
        \end{equation}
        Notice $\L(2s,\z)$ has simple poles at $s = 0$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$ (one from the Riemann zeta function and one from the gamma factor) and no others. It follows that $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ has a simple pole at $s = 0$ coming from the $y^{s}$ term in
        \cref{equ:constant_coefficient_of_completed_non-holomorphic_Eisenstein_series}, and by the functional equation there is also a pole at $s = 1$ coming from the $y^{1-s}$ term. At $s = \frac{1}{2}$, both terms in \cref{equ:constant_coefficient_of_completed_non-holomorphic_Eisenstein_series} have simple poles and we will show that the singularity there is removable. Recall $\G\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}$. Also, by \cref{prop:zeta_residue}, $\Res_{s = \frac{1}{2}}\z(2s) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\Res_{s = \frac{1}{2}}\z(2(1-s)) = -\frac{1}{2}$. So altogether
        \[
          \Res_{s = \frac{1}{2}}E^{\ast}(z,s) = \Res_{s = \frac{1}{2}}[y^{s}\L(2s,\z)+y^{1-s}\L(2(1-s),\z)] = \frac{1}{2}y^{\frac{1}{2}}-\frac{1}{2}y^{\frac{1}{2}} = 0.
        \]
        Hence the singularity at $s = \frac{1}{2}$ is removable. As for the residues at $s = 0$ and $s = 1$, the functional equation implies that they are negatives of each other. So it suffices to compute the residue at $s = 0$. Recall $\z(0) = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $\Res_{s = 0}\G(s) = 1$. Then together we find
        \[
          \Res_{s = 0}E^{\ast}(z,s) = \Res_{s = 0}y^{s}\L(2s,\z) = -\frac{1}{2}.
        \]
      \end{proof}

      This completes our study of the real-analytic Eisenstein series $E_{\infty}(z,s)$.
    \subsection*{The Integral Representation of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f \ox g)$}{L(s,f \ox g)}: Part II}
      We can now continue with the Rankin-Selberg convolution $L(s,f \ox g)$. Writing \cref{equ:Rankin-Selberg_integral-reresentation} in terms of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ and $L(s,f \ox g)$ results in the integral representation
      \[
        L(s,f \ox g) = \frac{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}\pi^{s}}{\G(s+k-1)\G(s)}\int_{\mc{F}}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{k}E^{\ast}(z,s)\,d\mu.
      \]
      This integral representation will give analytic continuation. To see this, note that the gamme factors are analytic for $\Re(s) < 0$. By the functional equation for $E^{\ast}(z,s)$, the integral is invariant as $s \to 1-s$. These two facts together give analytic continuation to $\C$ outside of the critial strip. The continuation inside of the critical strip will be meromorphic because of the poles of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$. To see this, taking the integral representation and substituting the Fourier series for $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ gives
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:integral_representation_Rankin_Selberg}
        \begin{aligned}
          L(s,f \ox g) &= \frac{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}\pi^{s}}{\G(s+k-1)\G(s)}\bigg[\int_{\mc{F}}f(x+iy)\conj{g(x+iy)}y^{k}(y^{s}\L(2s,\z)+y^{1-s}\L(2(1-s),\z))\,\frac{dx\,dy}{y^{2}} \\
          &+\int_{\mc{F}}f(x+iy)\conj{g(x+iy)}y^{k}\sum_{n \neq 0}2|n|^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\s_{1-2s}(|n|)\sqrt{y}K_{s-\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi|n|y)e^{2\pi inx}\,\frac{dx\,dy}{y^{2}}\bigg],
        \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}
      and we are reduced to showing that both integrals are locally absolutely uniformly bounded in the critial strip and away from the poles of $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ . Indeed, the first integral is locally absolutely uniformly bounded in this region by \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. As for the second integral, \cref{equ:non-constant_Fourier_coefficient_bound_non-holomorphic_Eisenstein_series} implies that it is
      \[
        O_{\e}\left(\int_{\mc{F}}f(x+iy)\conj{g(x+iy)}y^{k}\sum_{n \ge 1}4n^{\frac{1}{2}-s+\e}\sqrt{y}e^{-2\pi ny}\,\frac{dx\,dy}{y^{2}}\right).
      \]
      As the sum in the integrand is holomorphic, we can now appeal to \cref{met:decay_compacta_integral}. The meromorphic continuation to the critical strip and hence to all of $\C$ follows. In particular, $L(s,f \ox g)$ has at most simple poles at $s = 0$ and $s = 1$. Actually, there is no pole at $s = 0$. Indeed, $\g(s,f \ox g)$ has a simple pole at $s = 0$ coming from the gamma factors and therefore its reciprocal has a simple zero. This cancels the simple pole at $s = 0$ coming from $E^{\ast}(z,s)$ and therefore $L(s,f \ox g)$ is has a removable singularity at $s = 0$. So there is at worst a simple pole at $s = 1$.
    \subsection*{The Functional Equation, Critical Strip \& Residues of \texorpdfstring{$L(s,f \ox g)$}{L(s,f \ox g)}}
      An immediate consequence of the symmetry of integral representation is the functional equation:
      \[
        \frac{\G(s+k-1)\G(s)}{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}\pi^{s}}L(s,f \ox g) = \frac{\G((1-s)+k-1)\G(1-s)}{(4\pi)^{(1-s)+k-1}\pi^{1-s}}L(1-s,f \ox g).
      \]
      Applying the Legendre duplication formula for the gamma function twice we see that
      \begin{equation}\label{equ:duplication_for_Rankin-Selberg_gamma_factor}
        \begin{aligned}
          \frac{\G(s+k-1)\G(s)}{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}\pi^{s}} &= \frac{2^{2s+k-3}}{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}\pi^{s+1}}\G\left(\frac{s+k-1}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+k}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+1}{2}\right) \\
          &= \frac{1}{2^{k+1}\pi^{k}}\pi^{-2s}\G\left(\frac{s+k-1}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+k}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+1}{2}\right).
        \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}
      The factor in front is independent of $s$ and can therefore be canceled in the functional equation. We identify the gamma factor as:
      \[
        \g(s,f \ox g) = \pi^{-2s}\G\left(\frac{s+k-1}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+k}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+1}{2}\right),
      \]
      with $\mu_{1,1} = k-1$, $\mu_{2,2} = k$, $\mu_{1,2} = 0$, and $\mu_{2,1} = 1$ the local roots at infinity. The completed $L$-function is
      \[
        \L(s,f \ox g) = \pi^{-2s}\G\left(\frac{s+k-1}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+k}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+1}{2}\right)L(s,f \ox g),
      \]
      so the conductor is $q(f \ox g) = 1$ and no primes ramify. Clearly $q(f \ox g) \mid q(f)^{2}q(g)^{2}$ and conductor dropping does not occur. Then
      \[
        \L(s,f \ox g) = \L(1-s,f \ox g),
      \]
      is the functional equation of $L(s,f \ox g)$. In particular, the root number $\e(f \ox g) = 1$, and $L(s,f \ox g)$ is self-dual. We can now show that $L(s,f \ox g)$ is of order $1$. Since the possible pole at $s = 1$ is simple, multiplying by $(s-1)$ clears the possible polar divisor. As the integrals in the integral representation are absolutely bounded, computing the order amounts to estimating the gamma factor. Since the reciprocal of the gamma function is of order $1$, we have
      \[
        \frac{1}{\g(s,f \ox g)} \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}},
      \]
      for any $\e > 0$. So the reciprocal of the gamma factor is also of order $1$. Then we find that
      \[
        (s-1)L(s,f \ox g) \ll_{\e} e^{|s|^{1+\e}}.
      \]
      Thus $(s-1)L(s,f \ox g)$ is of order $1$, and so $L(s,f \ox g)$ is as well after removing the polar divisor. At last, we compute the residue of $L(s,f \ox g)$ at $s = 1$:

      \begin{proposition}
        Let $f,g \in \mc{S}_{k}(\PSL_{2}(\Z))$ be primitive Hecke eigenforms. Then
        \[
          \Res_{s = 1}L(s,f \ox g) = \frac{4^{k}\pi^{k+1}V}{2\G(k)}\<f,g\>,
        \]
        where $\<f,g\>$ is the Petersson inner product.
      \end{proposition}
      \begin{proof}
        As $V = \frac{\pi}{3}$, \cref{equ:completed_real-analytic_Eisenstein_series_residues} implies
        \[
          \Res_{s = 1}L(s,f \ox g) = \frac{4^{k}\pi^{k+1}}{\G(k)}\Res_{s = 1}\int_{\mc{F}}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{k}E^{\ast}(z,s)\,d\mu = \frac{4^{k}\pi^{k+1}V}{2\G(k)}\<f,g\>.
        \]
      \end{proof}

      Notice that if $g = f$, then $\<f,f\> \neq 0$ and therefore the residue at $s = 1$ is not zero and hence not a removable singularity. Actually, this is the only instance in which there is a pole since \cref{thm:newforms_characterization_holomorphic} implies that the primitive Hecke eigenforms are orthogonal so that $\<f,g\> = 0$ unless $f = g$. We summarize all of our work into the following theorem:

      \begin{theorem}
        For any two primitive Hecke eigenforms $f,g \in \mc{S}_{k}(\PSL_{2}(\Z))$, $L(s,f \ox g)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function. For $\Re(s) > 1$, it has locally absolutely uniformly convergent degree $4$ Euler product given by
        \[
          L(s,f \ox g) = \prod_{p}\prod_{1 \le i,j \le 2}\left(1-\a_{i}(p)\conj{\b_{j}(p)}p^{-s}\right)^{-1}.
        \]
        Moreover, it admits meromorphic continuation to $\C$ via the integral representation
        \[
          L(s,f \ox g) = \frac{(4\pi)^{s+k-1}\pi^{s}}{\G(s+k-1)\G(s)}\int_{\mc{F}}f(z)\conj{g(z)}\Im(z)^{k}E^{\ast}(z,s)\,d\mu,
        \]
        with functional equation
        \[
          \pi^{-2s}\G\left(\frac{s+k-1}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+k}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\G\left(\frac{s+1}{2}\right)L(s,f \ox g) = \L(s,f \ox g) = \L(1-s,f \ox g),
        \]
        and if $f = g$ there is simple pole at $s = 1$ of residue $\frac{4^{k}\pi^{k+1}V}{2\G(k)}\<f,g\>$.
      \end{theorem}
    \subsection*{The Rankin-Selberg Method}
      The Rankin-Selberg method in general is much more comlicated, but the argument is essentially the same. Let $f$ and $g$ both be primitive Hecke or Heck-Maass eigenforms with Hecke eigenvalues $\l_{f}(n)$ and $\l_{g}(n)$ respectively. We suppose $f$ has weight $k$/eigenvalue $\l$, level $N$, and character $\chi$, and $g$ has weight $\ell$/eigenvalue $\nu$, level $M$, and character $\psi$. 
      The $L$-function $L(s,f \x g)$ of $f$ and $g$ is give by the $L$-series
      \[
        L(s,f \x g) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f \x g}(n)}{n^{s}} = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f}(n)\conj{b_{g}(n)}}{n^{s}}.
      \]
      The \textbf{Rankin-Selberg convolution}\index{Rankin-Selberg convolution} $L(s,f \ox g)$ of $f$ and $g$ is defined as an $L$-series:
      \[
        L(s,f \ox g) = \sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{a_{f \ox g}(n)}{n^{s}} = L(2s,\chi\conj{\psi})L(s,f \x g),
      \]
      where $a_{f \ox g}(n) = \sum_{n = m\ell^{2}}(\chi\conj{\psi})(\ell^{2})a_{f}(m)\conj{b_{g}(m)}$. The following argument is the \textbf{Rankin-Selberg method}\index{Rankin-Selberg method}:

      \begin{method}[Rankin-Selberg method]
        Let $f$ and $b$ both be primitive Hecke or Heck-Maass eigenforms. Also suppose the following: 
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
          \item $f$ has weight $k$/eigenvalue $\l$, level $N$, and character $\chi$.
          \item $g$ has weight $\ell$/eigenvalue $\nu$, level $M$, and character $\psi$.
          \item The Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture holds if $f$ and $g$ are Heck-Maass eigenforms.
        \end{enumerate}
        Then the Rankin-Selberg convolution $L(s,f \ox g)$ is a Selberg class $L$-function.
      \end{method}

      We make a few remarks about the Rankin-Selberg method. Local uniform absolute convergence for $\Re(s) > 1$ (we must assume the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture in the Maass form case) are proved in the exactly the same way as we have described. The argument for the Euler product is also similar. However, if either $N > 1$ or $M > 1$, the computation becomes more difficult to compute since the local $p$ factors for $p \mid NM$ change. Moreover, the situation is increasingly complicated if $(N,M) > 1$ since conductor dropping can occur. The integral representation has a similar argument, but if the weights/eigenvalues are distinct the folding method becomes more complicated. In particular, after folding the resulting Eisenstein series is on $\G_{0}(NM)\backslash\H$. Moreover, if $NM > 1$, then there is more than just the cusp at $\infty$. The functional equation of the Eisenstein series at the $\infty$ cusp then reflects into a linear combination of Eisenstein series. Thus, we need to understand the Fourier coefficients of all of these Eisenstein series.
  \section{Applications of the Rankin-Selberg Method}
    \subsection*{The Ramanujan-Petersson Conjecture on Average}
      Let $f$ be a Hecke or Hecke-Maass eigenform. Using Rankin-Selberg convolutions, it is possible to show the weaker result that $a_{f}(n) \ll n^{\e}$ holds on average, for any $\e > 0$, without assuming the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture:
      
      \begin{proposition}\label{prop:Ramanujan_Petersson_average}
        Let $f$ be a primitive Hecke or Hecke-Maass eigenform. Then for any $X > 0$, we have
        \[
        \sum_{n \le X}a_{f}(n) \ll_{\e} X^{1+\e},
        \]
      \end{proposition}
      \begin{proof}
        By Cauchy-Schwarz,
        \begin{equation}\label{equ:Ramanujan_conjecture_on_average_1}
          \left(\sum_{n \le X}a_{f}(n)\right)^{2} \le X\sum_{n \le X}|a_{f}(n)|^{2},
        \end{equation}
        The Rankin-Selberg square $L(s,f \ox f)$ is locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore it still admits meromorphic continuation to $\C$ with a simple pole at $s = 1$. By Landau's theorem, the abscissa of absolute convergence of $L(s,f \ox f)$, and hence $L(s,f \x f)$ too, is $1$ so by \cref{prop:Dirichlet_series_coefficient_size_on_average} we have
        \[
          \sum_{n \le X}|a_{f}(n)|^{2} \ll_{\e} X^{1+\e},
        \]
        for any $\e > 0$. Substiuting this bound into \cref{equ:Ramanujan_conjecture_on_average_1}, we obtain
        \[
          \left(\sum_{n \le X}a_{f}(n)\right)^{2} \ll_{\e} X^{2+\e},
        \]
        and taking the square root yields
        \[
          \sum_{n \le X}a_{f}(n) \ll_{\e} X^{1+\e}.

      The bound in \cref{prop:Ramanujan_Petersson_average} should be compared with the implication $a_{f}(n) \ll n^{\e}$ that follows from the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture. While \cref{prop:Ramanujan_Petersson_average} is not useful in the holomorphic form case, it is in the Maass form case. Indeed, recall that if $f$ is a primitive Hecke-Maass eigenform we needed to assume the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture to ensure $a_{f}(n) \ll n^{\e}$ so that $L(s,f)$ was locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1$. However, \cref{prop:Dirichlet_series_convergence_polynomial_bound,prop:Ramanujan_Petersson_average} together imply that $L(s,f)$ is locally absolutely uniformly convergent for $\Re(s) > 1+\e$ and hence for $\Re(s) > 1$. This method avoides assuming the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture.
    \subsection*{Strong Multiplicity One}
      Let $f$ be a primitive Hecke or Hecke-Maass eigenform. Then $f$ is determined by Hecke eigenvalues at primes for fixed weight/eigenvalue and level. Using Rankin-Selberg convolutions, we can prove \textbf{strong multiplicity one}\index{strong multiplicity one} for holomorpic or Maass forms which says that $f$ is determined by Hecke eigenvalues at all but finitely many primes for fixed weight/eigenvalue, level, and character:

      \begin{theorem}[Strong multiplicity one, holomorphic and Maass versions]
        Let $f$ and $g$ both be primitive Hecke or Hecke-Maass eigenforms of the same weight/eigenvalue, level, and character. Denote the Hecke eigenvalues by $\l_{f}(n)$ and $\l_{g}(n)$ respectively. If $\l_{f}(p) = \l_{g}(p)$ for all but finitely many primes $p$, then $f = g$.
      \end{theorem}
      \begin{proof}
        Let $S$ be the set the primes for which $\l_{f}(p) \neq \l_{g}(p)$ including the primes that ramify for $L(s,f)$ and $L(s,g)$. By assumption, $S$ is finite. As the local factors of $L(s,f \ox g)$ are holomorphic and nonzero at $s = 1$, the order of the pole of $L(s,f \ox g)$ is the same as the order of the pole of
        \[
          L(s,f \ox g)\prod_{p \in S}L_{p}(s,f \ox g)^{-1} = \prod_{p \notin S}L_{p}(s,f \ox g).
        \]
        But as $f$ and $g$ have the same the weight/eigenvalue, level, and character, and $\l_{f}(p) = \l_{g}(p)$ for all $p \notin S$, we have
        \[
          \prod_{p \notin S}L_{p}(s,f \ox g) = \prod_{p \notin S}L_{p}(s,f \ox f).
        \]
        Since $L(s,f \ox f)$ has a simple pole at $s = 1$, it follows that $L(s,f \ox g)$ does too. But then $f = g$.
      \end{proof}
